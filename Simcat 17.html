Emperors from the Song era onward were significantly less likely to be deposed, an indication that the rulers had strengthened their power vis-\u00e0-vis the elite\u2026 In the 18th\u00a0century, the average reign of emperors reached almost 20 years\u2014on par with European monarchs and far surpassing Islamic rulers in the same era. However, ruled by long-living monarchs, the Chinese state gradually declined\u2026\r<br>\r<br>Why did long-lasting emperors have to govern a weak state? This was a fundamental dilemma that all Chinese sovereigns faced; after all, a coherent elite that could take collective actions to strengthen the state was also capable of revolting against the ruler. To stay in power, rulers must divide and conquer the elite\u2026\r<br>\r<br>[But] Chinese rulers were not always able to divide and conquer. During the Tang times, an aristocracy ruled China. This aristocracy was a semi-hereditary caste that consisted of several hundred noble clans which formed a close-knit marriage network in which status endogamy persisted for centuries. Coherent aristocratic interests constituted a credible check on monarchical power. It was a rare time in Chinese history when the emperor shared power with the elites. In the late Tang era, five of twelve Tang emperors were toppled by a coup; meanwhile, Tang China was the world\u2019s dominant empire. Tang merchants structured trade relations with the outside world on the ancient \u201csilk roads.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>A rebellion in the late 9th\u00a0century, led by the salt merchant Huang Chao, physically destroyed the Tang aristocracy and opened a new chapter in Chinese history. Starting in Song times, the emperors took advantage of the power vacuum left by the Tang aristocracy and restructured the elite. They expanded the civil service examinations to identify bureaucratic talent on a relatively meritocratic basis. The emperors exploited the fragmented and localized elite to establish an absolute monarchy at the expense of a much-contracted state.\r<br>\r<br>In the early 20th\u00a0century, imperial China fell not because of the Western intrusion, such as the Opium Wars, nor because of internal rebellions, such as the Taiping Rebellion. Imperial China collapsed because the emperors\u2019 relentless pursuit of power and survival crippled the Chinese state and made it unable to respond to these external and internal challenges.\r<br>\r<br>History does not repeat itself, but it rhymes. We are observing a new Chinese ruler who is trying to maximize his power and lengthen his rule. It is still too early to tell whether the Chinese state will decline, but the Chinese economy is already slowing down (even before the COVID-19 pandemic). A third term (and likely a fourth) might be good news for Xi Jinping. But if two thousand years of Chinese history tells us something, it is that the country often suffers from a ruler who refuses to leave.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Qin Dynasty, Tang Dynasty, Song Dynasty, Qing Dynasty<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">The passage mentions the dynasties in the following order: Qin Dynasty (221\u2013207 BCE), Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907), Song Dynasty (960\u20131127), and Qing Dynasty (1644\u20131911).

Other factors that might make an animal more trappable than its peers, besides its activity level, include a bold temperament, a lack of experience, or simply being hungrier.<br \/><br \/>Other research has shown that pheasants housed in groups of five&nbsp;performed better&nbsp;on a learning task than those housed in groups of only three&mdash;that&rsquo;s Social background. Jumping&nbsp;spiders&nbsp;raised in captivity were&nbsp;less interested in prey&nbsp;than wild spiders, and honeybees&nbsp;learned best&nbsp;in the morning. And so on.<br \/><br \/>Animals are not automatons. Some are bold, some are shy. Taking these personality factors into account can improve animal research&mdash;for science and for the subjects. It might be impossible to remove every bias from a group of study animals, Rutz says. But he and Webster want to encourage other scientists to think through STRANGE factors with every experiment, and to be transparent about how those factors might have affected their results. &ldquo;We used to assume that we could do an experiment the way we do chemistry&mdash;by controlling a variable and not changing anything else,&rdquo; says Holly Root-Gutteridge, who studies dog behavior. But research has been uncovering&nbsp;individual patterns of behavior&mdash;scientists sometimes call it personality&mdash;in all kinds of animals, from monkeys to&nbsp;hermit crabs.<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;Just because we haven&rsquo;t previously given animals the credit for their individuality or distinctiveness doesn&rsquo;t mean that they don&rsquo;t have it,&rdquo; Root-Gutteridge says. This failure of human imagination, or empathy, mars some classic experiments, Root-Gutteridge and coauthors noted in a&nbsp;2022 paper&nbsp;focused on animal welfare issues. For example, experiments by psychologist Harry Harlow in the 1950s involved baby rhesus macaques and fake mothers made from wire. They allegedly gave insight into how human infants form attachments. But given that these monkeys were torn from their mothers and kept unnaturally isolated, are the results really generalizable, the authors ask? Or do Harlow&rsquo;s findings apply only to his uniquely traumatized animals?<\/p>","PassageTitle":".","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1.

For this reason, it is commonly used in linguistics research.<br><br>The subjects were native speakers of English, Chinese, or Semitic languages. After listening to different recordings, they were asked, \u201cHow much do you like the sound of this language?\u201d They then could respond on a scale ranging from \u201cnot at all\u201d to \u201cvery much.\u201d Participants were also asked if they recognized the language. If they marked yes, they were asked to identify it.<br><br>Analyzing data from the surveys, the researchers found that subjects rated languages that they recognized 12.2% higher, even if they had misidentified the language. But,\u00a0\u201cthere were only negligible differences between world regions when the language was not recognized,\u201d the authors reported, \u201csuggesting that languages spoken in different parts of the world do not sound intrinsically beautiful or unpleasant, regardless of the listeners\u2019 own first language.\u201d<br><br>Controlling for familiarity, most languages scored within 2% to 3% of each other in pleasantness. Though not statistically separate from the pack, a couple of languages did surface at the top and bottom. At the very top was Tok Pisin, spoken throughout Papua New Guinea. Six percentage points down from Tok Pisin at the bottom was Chechen, which is spoken by people in the North Caucasus.<br>The researchers also monitored different acoustic characteristics of the recordings to see if these would affect how the languages were rated. Overall, there was a possible slight preference for nontonal languages, they found. In tonal languages, altering the tone of a spoken word changes the word\u2019s meaning. The researchers also noticed that increasingly higher vocal pitches slightly lowered the score of the linked language. Additionally, if the clip featured a male speaker, the language scored about 4 points lower. On the other hand, if the clip featured a \u201cbreathy female voice,\u201d the language was rated as much more pleasant. \u201cVoices are more appealing if they sound healthy and sex-typical,\u201d the researchers commented, \u201cpresumably because we have evolved to look for signs of fitness in the voice, creating some universal standards of auditory beauty analogous to the appeal of\u2026 symmetrical faces and unblemished skin.\u201d<br><br>The experiment was well designed but had its drawbacks. For example, it could have benefited from a greater number of raters from additional language backgrounds. Moreover, the spoken phrases they rated could have been better standardized to control for differences in speaking styles, loudness, and vocal characteristics. Still, overall, the study constitutes a fascinating exploration of the spoken word, revealing that a language\u2019s beauty is likely not intrinsic, but rather exists in the ear of the listener.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><br><br>Modern conceptions of capitalism standardly refer to subjects like states and markets, prices and profits, etc. Curiously, none of these modern versions makes much reference to subjects like war and the costs of war, public debt and public administration, or even justice and expediency [which] formed the core of the concept of capitalism in the early nineteenth century.<br><br>The differences between the conceptual connotations of \u2018Capitalism\u2019\u2014one earlier, the other later\u2014raise two interesting questions. The first is how and why one set of connotations changed into the other. The second is about how to evaluate the relative significance of the qualities involved in the concept of capitalism. The genealogy of the word could, in short, be a guide to the genealogy of the thing.<br><br>In the beginning, the word referred to several different subjects. \u201cCapitalism\u201d began as a French word (capitalisme) but was used initially to refer to several largely British problems.\u00a0The most salient was the modern (eighteenth-century) system of war finance, or the practice of borrowing large amounts of money\u2014or capital\u2014to fund the costs of war. In French, someone who lent money to a branch of the French royal government was called a capitalist (capitaliste). The French word, however, was given an English salience by a widely noticed prediction about the British system of government, or what contemporaries called the English constitution, that was published in 1748 by Charles Louis de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu in his influential book, The Spirit of Laws. \u201cAs all human things have an end\u201d, Montesquieu wrote, \u201cthe state we are speaking of will lose its liberty, will perish when the legislative power shall be more corrupt than the executive\u201d. Public debt, on some interpretations, favoured this bleak prediction. It freed the executive from dependence on the legislature for grants of tax revenue, enabled it to use money and office to build up and maintain a party of its own, and gave it a freer hand in decisions over war and peace\u2026<br><br>Two further developments favoured the crystallisation of capital and capitalistes into capitalisme. One was the appearance of the concept of the division of labour in Adam Smith\u2019s the Wealth of Nations in 1776 and its bearing on what Smith called a commercial society. The second was the use made of a combination of Smith\u2019s concepts and Montesquieu\u2019s \u201cprophecy\u201d by a French royalist writer named Louis de Bonald. To Bonald, trying to replace the republican system established during the French Revolution with a more balanced, British-style constitutional regime was to jump out of the frying pan into the fire. Opting to do so, Bonald warned, amounted to endorsing Montesquieu\u2019s prophecy without registering its consequences. The real alternative to Jacobin republicanism, he argued, was not British constitutionalism, but absolute monarchy\u2026<br><br>Positioning the concept of capitalism in a context that, right from the start, was significantly more apocalyptic than that of an industrial revolution or an economic category helps to explain the urgency and intensity of efforts made to understand the nature of the thing itself. It makes it possible too to bring a fresh approach to the thought of what was involved in the unexpected transformation of public debt and warfare into social democracy and welfare. In this setting, public credit was not a synonym for capitalism but the antidote to capitalism.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1.\u00a0This statement is not supported by the passage.

Some portion of the graph from its lower part has been deleted by mistake (as shown in the graph below). The numerical values inside the bars represent only the portion of the graph that has not been deleted.

Venkatesh was preparing a table containing data related to the number of eggs laid by these 70 birds in the first ten days of the month. The data shows that at least 4% and at most 20% of the daily produce are rotten eggs. He further noticed that the daily percentage figures of rotten eggs with respect to total eggs laid is always an integer. The number of rotten eggs laid on the second and third days was the same. Surprisingly, the number of eggs laid on the second and third days was the same and each of them was less than the total number of eggs laid on day one.<br \/><br \/>The table below shows the data collected by Venkatesh on the total number of eggs and rotten eggs laid in the first days of a month.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

Although each hen is supposed to lay one egg every day, it doesn&rsquo;t happen all the days. However, at least 85% of birds lay eggs on a day. No hen lays more than one egg on a day. Venkatesh was preparing a table containing data related to the number of eggs laid by these 70 birds in the first ten days of the month. The data shows that at least 4% and at most 20% of the daily produce are rotten eggs. He further noticed that the daily percentage figures of rotten eggs with respect to total eggs laid is always an integer. The number of rotten eggs laid on the second and third days was the same. Surprisingly, the number of eggs laid on the second and third days was the same and each of them was less than the total number of eggs laid on day one.<br \/><br \/>The table below shows the data collected by Venkatesh on the total number of eggs and rotten eggs laid in the first days of a month.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

Although each hen is supposed to lay one egg every day, it doesn&rsquo;t happen all the days. However, at least 85% of birds lay eggs on a day. No hen lays more than one egg on a day. Venkatesh was preparing a table containing data related to the number of eggs laid by these 70 birds in the first ten days of the month. The data shows that at least 4% and at most 20% of the daily produce are rotten eggs. He further noticed that the daily percentage figures of rotten eggs with respect to total eggs laid is always an integer. The number of rotten eggs laid on the second and third days was the same. Surprisingly, the number of eggs laid on the second and third days was the same and each of them was less than the total number of eggs laid on day one.<br \/><br \/>The table below shows the data collected by Venkatesh on the total number of eggs and rotten eggs laid in the first days of a month.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

Although each hen is supposed to lay one egg every day, it doesn&rsquo;t happen all the days. However, at least 85% of birds lay eggs on a day. No hen lays more than one egg on a day. Venkatesh was preparing a table containing data related to the number of eggs laid by these 70 birds in the first ten days of the month. The data shows that at least 4% and at most 20% of the daily produce are rotten eggs. He further noticed that the daily percentage figures of rotten eggs with respect to total eggs laid is always an integer. The number of rotten eggs laid on the second and third days was the same. Surprisingly, the number of eggs laid on the second and third days was the same and each of them was less than the total number of eggs laid on day one.<br \/><br \/>The table below shows the data collected by Venkatesh on the total number of eggs and rotten eggs laid in the first days of a month.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

Although each hen is supposed to lay one egg every day, it doesn&rsquo;t happen all the days. However, at least 85% of birds lay eggs on a day. No hen lays more than one egg on a day. Venkatesh was preparing a table containing data related to the number of eggs laid by these 70 birds in the first ten days of the month. The data shows that at least 4% and at most 20% of the daily produce are rotten eggs. He further noticed that the daily percentage figures of rotten eggs with respect to total eggs laid is always an integer. The number of rotten eggs laid on the second and third days was the same. Surprisingly, the number of eggs laid on the second and third days was the same and each of them was less than the total number of eggs laid on day one.<br \/><br \/>The table below shows the data collected by Venkatesh on the total number of eggs and rotten eggs laid in the first days of a month.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;
