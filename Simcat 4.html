Choose the best answer to each question. <\/b>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Mancur<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> Olson was among the first economists who studied the private provision of public goods in detail: \u201cIt is of the essence of an organization that it provides an inseparable, generalized benefit. It follows that the provision of public or collective goods is the fundamental function of organizations generally\u2026. There is no suggestion here that <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">states<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> or other organizations provide only public or collective goods. Governments often provide noncollective goods like electric power and they usually sell such goods on the market.\u201d<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The coupling of private and public goods is one mechanism through which private enterprises can be enabled to provide public goods. In the eighteenth century, lighthouses were non-rivalrous and non-excludable public good. But port spaces were private goods. British lighthouses were financed by imposing dues on ship owners at the ports. A public good that is coupled with a private good is called an \u201cimpure\u201d public good. Some shopping malls offer common spaces and infrastructure for which shoppers pay through supplements to the merchandise. If charging for parking is too expensive, parking becomes a public good, allowing non-shoppers to use it for free. If a nearby landowner builds a shopping mall without parking, they can offer lower prices and drive out competitors. To avoid this, the first mall owner can buy the surrounding land before free parking is allowed. This is known as \"extending the role of the firm\" to solve externalities.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Private provision of public goods may occur because people do not always act purely in their self-interest. Economic models often assume that individuals only care about the benefits they receive from a public good, but people also care about how the public good affects others. Donations to charity and political campaigns illustrate this <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">behavior<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">. Some models incorporate the notion that the act of giving itself provides additional satisfaction beyond the actual public good provided.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A third reason for the ability of public goods to be provided privately is the existence of social norms. Social norms can encourage private provision of public goods. That a non-co-operative strategy is not necessarily optimal in repeated games is a well-known result in game theory. In repeated games norms like fairness and equality can increase private contributions. Social norms can motivate people to act altruistically but also help to solve co-ordination problems by specifying property rights and the terms of contracts. Clean streets can be regarded as a public <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">good, and<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> let us assume that littering isn\u2019t punishable by law. In a game-theoretic setting, individuals would be expected to underproduce the public good, i.e., to litter too much. A norm not to litter can now help to induce people to co-operate and play the non-Nash equilibrium but Pareto superior strategy. The punishment of norm-violators through social sanctions will help to make people follow the norm without the government having to police norm following.<\/span>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The last paragraph discusses the role of social norms in promoting private provision of public goods. It mentions that social norms can encourage people to act altruistically and help to solve coordination problems by specifying property rights and the terms of contracts. It also gives an example of how a norm against littering can induce people to cooperate and play the non-Nash equilibrium but Pareto superior strategy. Therefore, the \"well-known result in game theory\" mentioned in the paragraph suggests that social norms and punishment of norm-violators can play an important role in the provision of public goods.<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Option 1 is incorrect because the paragraph does not compare the cooperative&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">behavior<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> of consumers in private provision and government provision of public goods.<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Option 3 is incorrect because the paragraph does not suggest that decision-making in the provision of public goods should be governed by principles of game theory.

This lack of evidence is due to a host of challenges making this type of research extraordinarily difficult.

Several prospective studies have now found very small (or nonsignificant) correlations between perceived change and actual change.

Several gradients of parameters acting together with different times and rates on systems with a large number of <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">degree<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> of freedom can determine non-linearity, chaos and self-organization that can ultimately evolve into catastrophic collective <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">behaviors<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A gradient generates forces producing or being the expression of a difference of a certain physical observable in time or space. Earth hosts Life because of the mobility of its mantle, thermal gradients inducing volcanic eruptions and velocity differences among crustal volumes provoking faulting, mountain growth and ocean spreading.<\/span><br><br>What is the nature of these planetary gradients? How can we study them and how do they punctuate Earth dynamics? Each gust of wind is determined by atmospheric pressure gradient: areas where atmospheric pressure is greater push air toward areas of lower pressure. The greater the gradient, the faster the winds. Cyclones, tornadoes, <span style=\"color: #000000;\">rain<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> and snow are controlled by those gradients. For analogous reasons, in the two hemispheres, the Coriolis force plays <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">opposite<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> and the linear velocity gradient induces clockwise or counter<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">clockwise atmospheric circulation. Rivers flow downstream because of a topographic gradient and therefore a gravitational one: gravity never stops working. Atmospheric disturbances determine heavy rains, which in turn lower the friction in the soil and rocks, causing landslides: it is a succession of gradients that shape the Earth\u2019s surface, with a tendency to decrease or eliminate morphological irregularities.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Volcanoes erupt violently because inside the magma chambers, where the lava accumulates and melts the embedded rocks, pressure gradients are created that break through the overlying Earth\u2019s crust. The density gradient that is generated for the thermal expansion of molten rocks contributes to the ascent of magma together with gas bubble coalescence that, as soon as reaches the surface, finds an opposite gradient producing lava flows on the sides of the volcanic apparatus, or disperses with pyroclastic clouds. The higher is the viscosity of magmas, the greater is the pressure gradient that manages to accumulate, and the viscosity generally tends to increase with the silica content of the magma. The higher the magma viscosity, the greater the explosiveness and the episodic nature of volcanism: this is an example of chemical gradient affecting geophysical dynamics.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Gradients are determined by variations in pressure, temperature, chemical and mineralogical composition, friction, rigidity, viscosity, electromagnetic field, etc. The greatest the gradient, the largest the energy involved, yielding a wide range of manifestations at different spatial and temporal scales. The surface of the Earth is featured by complex geological patterns produced by both endogenous and exogenous events playing as a mirror of phenomena acting since the dawn of our planet.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The challenge confronting the informational state of the public is the accelerating spread of misinformation and disinformation on the internet. On Twitter falsehoods spread further and faster than the truth. <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">And,<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> online misinformation and disinformation in a wide variety of forms have created serious issues vis-\u00e0-vis public belief and democratic functioning.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In response to \u201cfake news\u201d, programmers have built algorithms that aim to judge the veracity of online stories. Researchers explore which features of an article are the most reliable identifiers of fake news. These sorts of tools have some promise as part of the enterprise of social epistemology. But their power to discriminate true stories from false ones has limited reliability.\u00a0 As O\u2019Connor and Weatherall (2019) point out, online misinformation constitutes a kind of arms race. As platforms and programmers and governments develop tools to fight it, the purveyors of misinformation will develop new methods of shaping public belief.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">All ill-informed <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">populace<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> may not be able to effectively represent their interests in a democratic society. It will be necessary for those fighting online misinformation to keep adapting with the best tools and theory available to them. This includes understanding social aspects of knowledge and belief formation. In other words, social epistemology has much to say to those faced with the challenging task of protecting democracy from misinformation.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Some recent writers seek to expand the notion of social epistemology by incorporating moral or ethical elements. Miranda Fricker has made significant contributions to this literature. Fricker introduces the notion of \u201cepistemic injustice,\u201d which arises when somebody is wronged in their capacity as a knower \u2013 when a person or a social group is unfairly deprived of knowledge because of their lack of adequate access to education or other epistemic resources. Fricker\u2019s work also focuses on two less obvious forms of epistemic injustice. The first is testimonial injustice, which occurs when a speaker is given less credibility than she deserves because the hearer has prejudices about a social group to which the speaker belongs. The second kind is hermeneutical injustice. This occurs when, <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">as a result of<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> a group being socially powerless, members of the group lack the conceptual resources to make sense of certain distinctive social experiences.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">These issues are relevant epistemological ones for those in democratic societies. Epistemic injustices may leave some members of society ill-equipped to engage in the debates that fuel a well-functioning democracy. Testimonial injustice may prevent the spread of important information and perspectives through a community.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Misinformation can also pose epistemic threats to democratic functioning. With respect to internet misinformation, we might ask: do we have a right to protection against such misinformation? Is it morally acceptable for internet platforms, or government bodies, to protect public belief by regulating and limiting misinformation? There are deep political and moral issues here. Free speech is protected in most democratic societies, but part of the <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">defense<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> of free speech is that it is crucial for freedom of thought. Once we recognize that human beliefs are deeply social, we might acknowledge that some sorts of speech interfere with our freedom of thought, and in some <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">cases<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> we may need to decide to protect one in lieu of the other.<\/span>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The passage primarily focuses on the issue of misinformation and disinformation on the internet and its effects on democratic functioning.
