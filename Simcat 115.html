What you may have forgotten &ndash; or, rather, cannot retrieve &ndash; is that when you were a young child, your grandparents had a cupboard just like this one in their home.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A related theory implies that we may perceive a person, place or event as familiar if at some earlier time in our lives we were exposed to just a partial aspect of the experience, even if it was within a different context. Perhaps, when you were young, your parents stopped at a flea market while on vacation and one vendor was selling old kitchen cupboards. Or perhaps you smell an odour that was also present at that flea market you attended as a child. A single element, only partially registered consciously, can trigger a feeling of familiarity by erroneously transferring itself to the present setting.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>These assumptions, which are founded on the unconscious processing of information, ultimately place responsibility for d&eacute;j&agrave; vu on gaps in our attention system. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re driving down a hectic street and are concentrating on the flow of traffic. An old lady is standing on the sidewalk; you see her in your peripheral vision, but you are not really consciously aware of her. A second later you have to stop at a traffic light. Now you have the time to look around. As you glance at the old woman, stepping with difficulty off the kerb into the crosswalk, leaning heavily on her cane, she suddenly seems familiar, even though you don&rsquo;t believe you have ever seen her before and you know you have not been at this intersection before. The first image of the woman, perceived during your distracted state, was immediately followed by a second image when you were fully alert. Because the information was received without conscious attention only shortly before, it is now falsely interpreted as a long-term memory.<\/p>","PassageTitle":"q","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Option 1:&nbsp; Incorrect.
