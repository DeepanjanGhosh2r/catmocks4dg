Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The true age of innovation \u2013 call it the Golden Quarter \u2013 ran from 1945 to 1971, spluttering to a halt more than 50 years ago. Just about everything that defines the modern world either came about, or had its seeds sown, during this time. The Pill. Electronics. Computers and the internet. Nuclear power. Television. Antibiotics. Space travel. Civil rights.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Why <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">has<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> progress stopped? Why, for that matter, did it start when it did in the dying embers of the Second World War? One explanation is that the Golden Age was the result of economic growth and technological spinoffs from the Second World War. It is true that the war sped the development of <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">weaponisable<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> technologies and medical advances. The Apollo space programme could not have happened when it did without the aerospace engineer Wernher Von Braun and the ballistic missile. But penicillin, the jet engine and even the nuclear bomb were on the drawing board before the first shots were fired\u2026 Conflict spurs innovation, and the Cold War played its part \u2013 we would never have got to the Moon without it. But someone <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">has to<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> pay for everything. The economic boom came to an end in the 1970s with the collapse of Bretton Woods agreements and the oil shocks. So did the great age of innovation. Case closed. <\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">And yet, something doesn\u2019t quite fit. The 1970s recession was temporary: we came out of it soon enough. What\u2019s more, in terms of Gross World Product, the world is between two and three times richer now than it was then. <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">So<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> if rapid economic growth drove innovation in the 1950s and \u201960s, why has it not done so since? One argument is that progress ground to a halt because the \u2018low-hanging fruit\u2019 had been plucked off. These fruits include the cultivation of unused land, mass education, and the capitalisation by technologists of the scientific breakthroughs made in the 19th century. It is possible that the advances we saw in the period 1945-1970 were similarly quick wins, and that further progress is much harder\u2026<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">But history suggests that this explanation is fanciful. During periods of technological and scientific expansion, it has often seemed that a plateau has been reached, only for a new discovery to shatter old paradigms completely. The most famous example was when, in 1900, Lord Kelvin declared physics to be <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">more or less over<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">, just a few years before Einstein proved him comprehensively wrong\u2026 Lack of money is not the reason that innovation has stalled either. What we do with our money might be, however. Capitalism was once the great engine of progress. It was capitalism in the 18th and 19th centuries that built roads and railways, steam engines and telegraphs.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Despite the abundant evidence, contemporary empiricists who follow in the tradition of Locke and Mill and believe that all mathematical knowledge is acquired through experience remain <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">skeptical<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> about the existence of the number sense. This is because the ability to do arithmetic is traditionally considered a hard-won cultural achievement. Psychologists also have a checkered history of overinterpreting the numerical abilities of non-human animals.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez of the University of California, San Diego, argues that the number sense simply couldn't represent numbers because numbers are precise, and the number sense is imprecise. However, it is hard to see why the imprecision of the number sense should be taken to suggest that it is representing some attribute other than the number because any quantity can be represented imprecisely. If the number sense doesn't represent numbers, we need to say what it represents instead. In many studies of the number sense, other variables such as density, area, duration, height, weight, volume, brightness, and so on have been controlled for.<\/span><br><br>Late 19th-century German philosopher and logician Gottlob Frege noted that numbers are unique in that they presuppose a way of describing the stuff they quantify. Frege observed that other quantities aren't like this. If the number sense is sensitive to how stuff is described, we can guess that it truly represents numbers and not other quantities.<br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In a 2009 study, Steven <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Franconeri<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> of Northwestern University and his team presented subjects with a sequence of two screens containing circles and thin lines. Subjects were asked which screen had more circles and were told to ignore the thin lines entirely. But when lines connected two circles, effectively turning the pair of circles into a single dumbbell-shaped object, the subjects underestimated the number of circles on the screen. It seems they couldn't help but see a dumbbell as one object, even when they were trying to ignore the connecting lines and focus only on the circles.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The observers were not simply tracking some other quantity such as the total surface area of the items or the total number of pixels on the screen. After all, whether two circles and a line are connected to make a dumbbell doesn't affect the total surface area or pixel number. What it would, and seemingly did, affect is the perceived number of items in the display. So just as describing something as a deck of cards versus a collection of individual cards influences how you count it, whether you visually interpret something as a single dumbbell or a pair of circles, influences how many items you seem to see\u2014exactly as Frege would have predicted for a visual system that tracks number.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">None of this is to deny that the mathematical abilities endowed by humans are a product of cultural evolution, but it does suggest that the existence of the number sense is not in doubt. Infants and other non-human animals seem to have some sense of numbers, and researchers are only just beginning to understand how the number sense works.

Eventually, as the phosphorus supply came to outstrip the availability of alternative electron donors, cyanobacteria gained ecological importance. And as they did so, they transformed the world. The oxygen they produced scavenged other sources of electrons from sunlit waters, permanently tipping the biosphere toward oxygenic photosynthesis and oxygen-rich air. In this view, the Great Oxygenation Event [\u2026] was the interaction between Earth and life that transformed our planet\u2019s surface.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span>In early oceans, low phosphorus input from continents and limited recycling of phosphorus in upwelling deep waters constrained early life and limited photosynthesis.

So, C is from Std. 1 and E is from Std. 2.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>On day 3, A was the fourth person to pick up the question. He was also unable to answer the question. Using similar logic, that is possible only if A is from Std. 3 and questions for Std. 1, 2 and 3 were picked up by the previous three students i.e. C, D and E.

On day 1, day 3 and day 5, the students are allowed to search through the questions available on the table and they can pick any single question of their standard or below. However, if that question is not available because someone else has picked it and as a consequence, it has been removed from the table, they pick any random question to solve. <br \/>2. On day 2 and day 4, the students are not allowed to search through the questions available and they have to pick only one question randomly. Once a question is picked by a student, that question is removed from the table<span style=\"color: #444746;\">.<\/span> <br \/><br \/>The students attempt to solve the question picked from the table. They can solve any question corresponding to the level of difficulty of their own standard or below i.e. the student in Std. 1 solves only the question for Std. 1. However, the student in Std. 2 solves the questions for Std. 1 as well as for Std. 2 and so on. <br \/><br \/>The following table shows the order in which the students were sent to the table on different days.<\/p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 99.9682%; border-color: #000000; border-style: solid; float: left;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 17.713%; text-align: center;\">Order<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%; text-align: center;\">Day 1<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%; text-align: center;\">Day 2<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%; text-align: center;\">Day 3<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%; text-align: center;\">Day 4<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%; text-align: center;\">Day 5<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"width: 17.713%;\">1<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">A<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">B<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">C<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">D<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">E<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"width: 17.713%;\">2<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">B<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">C<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">D<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">E<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">A<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"width: 17.713%;\">3<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">C<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">D<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">E<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">A<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">B<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"width: 17.713%;\">4<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">D<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">E<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">A<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">B<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">C<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"width: 17.713%;\">5<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">E<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">A<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">B<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">C<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3912%;\">D<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p><br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The following table shows information on whether the question picked up by the students on different days could be solved or not.<\/p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 99.9682%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">Day 1<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">Day 2<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">Day 3<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">Day 4<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0827%; text-align: center;\">Day 5<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">A<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">Yes<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">No<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">No<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">Yes<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0827%; text-align: center;\">Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">B<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">Yes<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">Yes<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">Yes<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">Yes<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0827%; text-align: center;\">Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">C<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">No<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">No<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">Yes<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">Yes<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0827%; text-align: center;\">No<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">D<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">Yes<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">No<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">Yes<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">Yes<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0827%; text-align: center;\">No<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">E<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">No<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">No<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">No<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0704%; text-align: center;\">Yes<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.0827%; text-align: center;\">Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For example, A, B and D solved their questions on Day 1, while C and E did not solve their questions on Day 1.

Everyday five different questions in Mathematics (one question each at the Level of Difficulty corresponding to the syllabus of Std. 1 to Std. 5) are kept on the table. <br \/><br \/>Students are sent to the table one by one and they pick a question out of the questions placed on the table subject to the following rules: <br \/>1. On day 1, day 3 and day 5, the students are allowed to search through the questions available on the table and they can pick any single question of their standard or below. However, if that question is not available because someone else has picked it and as a consequence, it has been removed from the table, they pick any random question to solve. <br \/>2. On day 2 and day 4, the students are not allowed to search through the questions available and they have to pick only one question randomly.

These students participated in an event conducted over 5 days. Everyday five different questions in Mathematics (one question each at the Level of Difficulty corresponding to the syllabus of Std. 1 to Std. 5) are kept on the table. <br \/><br \/>Students are sent to the table one by one and they pick a question out of the questions placed on the table subject to the following rules: <br \/>1. On day 1, day 3 and day 5, the students are allowed to search through the questions available on the table and they can pick any single question of their standard or below. However, if that question is not available because someone else has picked it and as a consequence, it has been removed from the table, they pick any random question to solve. <br \/>2. On day 2 and day 4, the students are not allowed to search through the questions available and they have to pick only one question randomly. Once a question is picked by a student, that question is removed from the table<span style=\"color: #444746;\">.<\/span> <br \/><br \/>The students attempt to solve the question picked from the table. They can solve any question corresponding to the level of difficulty of their own standard or below i.e. the student in Std. 1 solves only the question for Std. 1.

These students participated in an event conducted over 5 days. Everyday five different questions in Mathematics (one question each at the Level of Difficulty corresponding to the syllabus of Std. 1 to Std. 5) are kept on the table. <br \/><br \/>Students are sent to the table one by one and they pick a question out of the questions placed on the table subject to the following rules: <br \/>1. On day 1, day 3 and day 5, the students are allowed to search through the questions available on the table and they can pick any single question of their standard or below. However, if that question is not available because someone else has picked it and as a consequence, it has been removed from the table, they pick any random question to solve. <br \/>2. On day 2 and day 4, the students are not allowed to search through the questions available and they have to pick only one question randomly. Once a question is picked by a student, that question is removed from the table<span style=\"color: #444746;\">.<\/span> <br \/><br \/>The students attempt to solve the question picked from the table. They can solve any question corresponding to the level of difficulty of their own standard or below i.e. the student in Std. 1 solves only the question for Std. 1.

Thus, Raju, Satish, and Milind are the top scorers in Sanskrit as they are the top scorers in French. It may happen that they have scored the same marks in French.
