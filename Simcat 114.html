A recent study, published in Science, suggests there isn&rsquo;t. The study measured the survival probabilities of 3,896 people in Italy aged 105 and older. It found that, while we are much more likely to die at 75 than at 55, once we reach about 105, the odds of death remain about the same each year of life.<br \/><br \/>This effect is often referred to as a &ldquo;mortality plateau&rdquo;. If it were impossible to live past a certain age, we would expect mortality rates to continue rising as people age, rather than plateau. The fact that the odds of dying don&rsquo;t appear to increase past 105 suggests that we have not yet approached our maximum lifespan as a species. But is potentially living for over a century something we ought to look forward to? Here, philosophy can offer some important insights.<br \/><br \/>Of course, we still don&rsquo;t know for sure that there is no ceiling. Some researchers argue that there is a natural &ldquo;expiration date&rdquo; for human beings, at about 125 years. Chiyo Miyako is currently the oldest known person in the world, at 117 years old. Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997, had the longest recorded lifespan, at 122 years.<br \/>In the UK, the number of people over the age of 100 has more than doubled since 2002, and could reach 36,000 by 2030. If there is a mortality plateau, by the year 2300 the oldest person alive could be about 150 years old.<br \/><br \/>Would a maximum lifespan of 150 make our lives better or just longer? One way of thinking about this is in terms of pleasure and pain: the more pleasure (and the less pain) we have over the course of our lives, the better our lives are. Other things being equal, a life which lasts 100 years is better than one that lasts 80 years, as long as the extra 20 years contain more pleasure than they do pain.<br \/><br \/>How likely an outcome is this?

Experiential interests are for things like pleasure &ndash; anything we enjoy.

            <li>Use only the latest version of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge</li>
