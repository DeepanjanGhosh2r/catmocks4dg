When linguists seek to develop a theory for why a given language works as it does, they are building consciously and laboriously an explicit version of the grammar that the child builds instinctively and with minimal exposure to information. The child\u2019s operating system is completely different from that of a machine learning program.\r<br>\r<br>Indeed, such programs are stuck in a prehuman or nonhuman phase of cognitive evolution. Their deepest flaw is the absence of the most critical capacity of any intelligence: to say not only what is the case, what was the case and what will be the case \u2014 that\u2019s description and prediction \u2014 but also what is not the case and what could and could not be the case. Those are the ingredients of explanation, the mark of true intelligence.  An explanation includes not only descriptions and predictions but also counterfactual conjectures like \u201cAny such object would fall,\u201d plus the additional clause \u201cbecause of the force of gravity\u201d or \u201cbecause of the curvature of space-time\u201d or whatever. That is a causal explanation: \u201cThe apple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity.\u201d That is thinking. The crux of machine learning is description and prediction; it does not posit any causal mechanisms or physical laws. Of course, any human-style explanation is not necessarily correct; we are fallible. But this is part of what it means to think: To be right, it must be possible to be wrong\u2026 Human-style thought is based on possible explanations and error correction, a process that gradually limits what possibilities can be rationally considered. \r<br>\r<br>But ChatGPT and similar programs are, by design, unlimited in what they can \u201clearn\u201d (which is to say, memorize); they are incapable of distinguishing the possible from the impossible...They trade merely in probabilities that change over time.\u2026 Even in instances when such programs can successfully generate correct \u201cscientific\u201d predictions without using explanations, such prediction is pseudoscience. While scientists certainly seek theories that have a high degree of empirical corroboration, they don\u2019t seek highly probable theories but explanations; that is to say, powerful and highly improbable theories. True intelligence is demonstrated in the ability to think and express improbable but insightful things. True intelligence is also capable of moral thinking. This means constraining the otherwise limitless creativity of our minds with a set of ethical principles that determines what ought and ought not to be (and of course subjecting those principles themselves to creative criticism).","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"Option 1. This option highlights the difference in cognitive evolution between human minds and machine learning programs. While it is true that the passage describes machine learning programs as being in a \"prehuman or nonhuman phase of cognitive evolution,\" this option doesn't directly&nbsp;address the core distinction between the two: their approach to understanding and processing information.\r<br \/>Option 2. This option focuses on the difference in the way human minds and machine learning programs process information. While it is accurate that human minds seek explanations with limited data and don't rely on brute statistical correlations, this option only partially represents the key distinction. It doesn't emphasize the aspect of causal explanations and understanding of possibilities, which is central to the difference between human minds and machine learning programs.\r<br \/>Option 3. This option points out an important aspect of the key distinction between human minds and machine learning programs. It highlights that human minds focus on causal explanations, whereas machine learning programs rely on pattern matching without understanding causality or possibilities. While this option captures a significant part of the distinction, it doesn't fully encompass the idea of human thinking involving explanation, error correction, and rational limitation, as presented in the passage.\r<br \/>Option 4 best captures the key distinction between human minds and machine learning programs as described in the passage. The human mind focuses on understanding causal explanations, error correction, and rational limitation of possibilities, whereas machine learning programs rely on statistical pattern matching and predictions without providing causal explanations or understanding possible and impossible aspects of a situation. While options 2 and 3 touch on aspects of this distinction, option 4 more comprehensively encapsulates the main difference as presented in the passage.\r<br \/>Hence, [4].","ItemBankID":0,"Difficulty":"Easy","DifficultyLevel":"1669640319437","ItemBank":0,"QuestionPaper":0,"IsProofRead":null,"CorrectIndex":0,"QuestionPaperSectionID":1688467852087,"IsRequiredQuestion":null,"TestID":0,"IsQuestionPackTimer":null,"ItemOptionResponse":[{"ItemOptionID":"168846829575430","ItemID":16884682957543,"Options":"The cognitive evolution of human minds and machine learning programs differs, with the latter being considered more primitive and ancestral in comparison to the former.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"168846829575431","ItemID":16884682957543,"Options":"Human minds, unlike machine learning programs don't rely on brute statistical correlations, instead efficiently seek explanations with limited data.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"168846829575432","ItemID":16884682957543,"Options":"Human minds grasp causal explanations, while machine learning relies on pattern matching without understanding causality or possibilities.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"168846829575433","ItemID":16884682957543,"Options":"Machine learning describes and predicts without positing causal mechanisms or laws; human thinking involves explanation, error correction, and rational limitation.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":true,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0}],"ItemMatrixSelectedColumns":[],"ItemMatrixResponse":[],"IsPassageQuestionSplit":true,"VideoExplanation":null,"PlayerMode":"S3","VimeoLink":null,"VimeoURI":null,"BookReference":null,"qindex":3,"qsectionindex":0,"qindexbysection":3},{"MaxWords":0,"ItemID":16884682957544,"ItemType":"mcq","SubjectName":"Verbal Ability","SubjectID":1589191865762,"AreaName":"Reading Comprehension","AreaID":1589191865815,"TopicName":"Central Idea","TopicID":1589191866680,"SubTopicName":"Central Idea","SubTopicID":1589191866728,"ItemOptions":null,"StarRating":null,"ItemBankName":null,"Direction":null,"IsApproved":null,"Items":"<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span>\tWhich of the following statements best describes (the main idea) of the passage?","ItemPassageID":16884682957502,"PassageItemIndex":0,"Passage":"<b>The passage below is accompanied by a set of questions.

Many wars are waged to gain or preserve wealth, but states have much less motive to initiate war if they are already wealthy.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Liberalism's optimistic view of international politics is based on three core beliefs, which are common to almost <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">all of<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> the theories in the paradigm. First, liberals consider states to be the main actors in international politics. Second, they emphasize that the internal characteristics of states vary considerably, and that these differences have profound effects on state <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">behavior<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">. Furthermore, liberal theorists often believe that some internal arrangements (e.g.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> democracy) are inherently preferable to others (e.g., dictatorship). For liberals, therefore, there are \"good\" and \"bad\" states in the international system. Good states pursue cooperative policies and hardly ever start wars on their own, whereas bad states cause conflicts with other states and are prone to use force to get their way. Thus, the key to peace is to populate the world with good states.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Third, liberals believe that calculations about power matter little for explaining the behaviour of good states. Bad states might be motivated by the desire to gain power at the expense of other states\u2026. In an ideal world, where there are only good states, power would be largely irrelevant.<\/span><br>Among the various theories found under the big tent of liberalism, the three main ones mentioned earlier are influential. The first argues that high levels of economic interdependence among states make them unlikely to fight each other. The taproot of stability, according to this theory, is the creation and maintenance of a liberal economic order that allows for free economic exchange among states. Such an order makes states more prosperous, thereby bolstering peace, because prosperous states are more economically satisfied and satisfied states are more peaceful. Many wars are waged to gain or preserve wealth, but states have much less motive to initiate war if they are already wealthy. Furthermore, wealthy states with interdependent economies stand to become less prosperous if they fight each other, since they are biting the hand that feeds them. Once states establish extensive economic ties, in short, they avoid war and can concentrate instead on accumulating wealth.<br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The second, democratic peace theory, claims that democracies do not go to war against other democracies. Thus, a world containing only democratic states would be a world without war. The argument here is not that democracies are less warlike than non-democracies, but rather that democracies do not fight among themselves.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Finally, some liberals maintain that international institutions enhance the prospects for cooperation among states and thus significantly reduce the likelihood of war. Institutions are not independent political entities that sit above states and force them to behave in acceptable ways. Instead, institutions are sets of rules that stipulate the ways in which states should cooperate and <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">compete with each other<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">. They prescribe acceptable forms of state behaviour and proscribe unacceptable kinds of behaviour. These rules are not imposed on states by some leviathan, but are negotiated by states, which agree to abide by the rules they created because it is in their interest to do so. Liberals claim that these institutions or rules can fundamentally change state behaviour. Institutions can discourage states from calculating self-interest <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">on the basis of<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> how their every move affects their relative power position, and thus they push states away from war and promote peace.<\/span>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\tThe passage is structured around liberal international relations theories and their views on state behaviour (including economic cooperation between them) and international cooperation.
