This is also why option 2 is not the correct choice. Besides option 2 is the other end of the extreme, dismissing the role of evolution in any biological trait or characteristic altogether and is therefore not compatible with the views of the author in the passage. Option 3, is not the central argument, and is not true based on the information of the passage - in paragraph 2, the author describes how sexual selection is the reason some birds have ostentatious plumage. There is no mention of the role of sexual selection being larger than it is deemed to be. Option 4 is not correct  because not only is it not the central premise of the passage but it is also incoherent with the information in the passage- \u201cAs human diets changed, the bones and muscles in our jaws became smaller so we didn\u2019t waste energy on them but we were left with a protruding bone at the bottom of the face\u2026Although the chin throws a spandrel in the works, there is nearly always a reason or, at least, an explanation for the myriad traits we see across biology.\u201d The author means therefore, that the chin is not a quirk that exists for its own sake but can actually be traced back to its evolutionary purpose.&nbsp;<span>Hence, [1]<\/span><span>.<\/span>","ItemBankID":0,"Difficulty":null,"DifficultyLevel":null,"ItemBank":0,"QuestionPaper":0,"IsProofRead":null,"CorrectIndex":0,"QuestionPaperSectionID":1690257904428,"IsRequiredQuestion":null,"TestID":0,"IsQuestionPackTimer":null,"ItemOptionResponse":[{"ItemOptionID":"724785","ItemID":16902584802510,"Options":"Seemingly obscure and useless traits of creatures actually have a reason or explanation \tthat ties in with evolution.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":true,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"724786","ItemID":16902584802510,"Options":"None of the biological traits and characteristics of humans and animals have a basis in \tfunctional adaptation or evolution.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"724787","ItemID":16902584802510,"Options":"Sexual selection may have had a much larger role to play in the evolutionary process \tthan was earlier believed.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"724788","ItemID":16902584802510,"Options":"Some of the physical or biological traits like the \u2018chin\u2019 are merely quirks that exist for \ttheir own sake.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0}],"ItemMatrixSelectedColumns":[],"ItemMatrixResponse":[],"IsPassageQuestionSplit":true,"VideoExplanation":"SimCAT-1-2019-VA-RC-Q.1","PlayerMode":"VIMEO","VimeoLink":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/366427873","VimeoURI":"\/videos\/366427873","BookReference":null,"qindex":0,"qsectionindex":0,"qindexbysection":0},{"MaxWords":0,"ItemID":16902584804121,"ItemType":"mcq","SubjectName":"Verbal Ability","SubjectID":1203,"AreaName":"Reading Comprehension","AreaID":2501,"TopicName":"Specific Detail","TopicID":34984,"SubTopicName":null,"SubTopicID":null,"ItemOptions":null,"StarRating":null,"ItemBankName":null,"Direction":null,"IsApproved":null,"Items":"<p>Which of the following is NOT true based on the information provided in the passage?<\/p>","ItemPassageID":18790,"PassageItemIndex":0,"Passage":"<p><strong> <\/strong><strong>The<\/strong><strong> passage below is accompanied by a set of questions.

It&rsquo;s hard to say why they haven&rsquo;t disappeared altogether but give it another million years and perhaps they will. Some snakes, for example, still show vestigial traits harking back to their four-legged ancestry. Male pythons have little claw-like structures towards the tail, which, although they aid courtship, are all that remain of their hind limbs. <br \/><br \/>Spandrels are in many ways, the rarest and hardest to see &ldquo;weird&rdquo; evolutionary quirks. The word comes from an architectural term for the triangular sections between arches in older, usually fancy, buildings. These zones were often ornately decorated but incidental to the real function of the structure of the building. An evolutionary spandrel is a physical structure or behavioural characteristic that is a by-product from some other functional adaptation. &hellip; One well-studied example is seen in an island-dwelling population of Italian wall lizards, which spend less time basking in the sun than their mainland cousins. This behaviour can be seen as a spandrel because there&rsquo;s no obvious advantage to it. <br \/><br \/>One genuine exception is something that defines our species as modern human beings: the chin. No other animals, or even extinct human relatives such as Neanderthals, have one. As human diets changed, the bones and muscles in our jaws became smaller so we didn&rsquo;t waste energy on them but we were left with a protruding bone at the bottom of the face. And no one has come up with a wholly convincing reason why. Although the chin throws a spandrel in the works, there is nearly always a reason or, at least, an explanation for the myriad traits we see across biology.<\/p>","PassageTitle":".","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>Option 1 is factually incorrect.
