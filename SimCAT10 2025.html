Choose the best answer to each question. <\/b><\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\">Global debt, according to a recent report by the Institute for International Finance, amounted to nearly $300 trillion last, equal to 356 percent of global GDP. This extraordinarily high debt level represents a 30 percentage-point rise in the global debt-to-GDP ratio in the past five years. No wonder analysts increasingly worry about the possible adverse consequences of excessive debt levels.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\">Unfortunately, few economists have a clear understanding of why too much debt is a bad thing, let alone how much debt is too much. That makes it hard to know what to worry about and why. Because economists tend to assume that the extent of a country\u2019s debt burden is measured by its national debt-to-GDP ratio, they often fail to distinguish between types of debt, instead treating a rise in one country\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio as equivalent to the same rise in another country\u2019s ratio, even though the two cases may have very different implications. So when is debt a burden for the economy and why? <\/span>Crucially, different kinds of rising debt can have very different effects on an economy. Moreover, even in countries that are seen as having too much debt, the adjustment costs can vary significantly.<br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\"> <\/span><br><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\">Before going into the different consequences of debt, it is necessary to discuss briefly some of the confusion that has arisen in recent years from a na\u00efve understanding of modern monetary theory (MMT). Many proponents of the theory have argued that MMT teaches that there are no spending constraints on a government that is monetarily sovereign (one that produces its own credible fiat currency) and that such a government can spend an unlimited amount without worrying about the consequences until there is a surge in inflation.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\">This simply isn\u2019t true. What MMT really shows is that there are no direct spending constraints on a government that is monetarily sovereign. It can always create money or debt to fund its spending needs without first needing to obtain the funding. This doesn\u2019t mean, however, that there are no indirect constraints. In fact, there are always economic constraints. This is because an economy cannot consume and invest more than it produces and imports, and any <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\">ex ante<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\"> imbalance between the two must be resolved by implicit or explicit transfers that reduce the purchasing power of some sector of the economy by enough to bring the two back into balance. <\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\">This is a simple idea, even if it isn\u2019t always well understood. Government spending, whether financed by money creation or debt creation, automatically increases the purchasing power of some sector of the economy, in effect increasing demand. If government spending simultaneously increases supply by an equivalent amount\u2014either directly (by funding investment in infrastructure, for example) or indirectly (by funding increases in consumption that in turn cause business investment to rise)\u2014there is indeed no meaningful constraint on government spending.<\/span>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">Refer to the last two paragraphs:<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">In effect they say: One of the indirect constraints to money creation or debt creation (MMT) is because consumption does not equal production (\u201ceconomy cannot consume and invest more than it produces and imports\u201d \u2013 in other words, demand and supply are not balanced). The next paragraph explains that if this mismatch is balanced by \u201cfinanced by money creation or debt creation\u201d there is no meaningful constraint on government spending. This is captured by option 3.&nbsp;<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">Option 1<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">. Incorrect. Unless ex ante imbalance is addressed, government spending may not be unrestricted.&nbsp;<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">Option 2. Incorrect. This is on the supply side.

Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) believed that we experience the sublime (as distinct from the beautiful) when we gain an awe-filled and sometimes frightening awareness of the world as existing outside of our own interests. Kant\u2019s example was a walker high in the Alps experiencing, in the form of the sublime, a mixture of terror and delight, but also, as he becomes more aware of his own isolated but powerful rationality, a defiant pride. In Murdoch\u2019s alternative, her spectator observes other people. For, she argues, when we become aware of the world as it exists outside our own interests, it is especially the particular that we notice.

We are probably more used to the idea as bearing on morals. In art we are more familiar with the idea that writers and painters must empathise with their characters. Murdoch does not dispute the need for empathy, but (no doubt thinking of her own experience as a novelist) she thinks that it is nonetheless important for fictional characters to be regarded from afar \u2013 to be left free, so to speak, to make their own mistakes, as they stumblingly attempt to apprehend each other\u2019s realities. She again makes the point that when we fail to respect the autonomy of another individual in both art and life, it is because we have been waylaid by convention or self-obsession. Either way, there can too easily be stereotyping or a too-quick summing up: \u201cForm is the temptation of love and its peril\u2026 to round off a situation, to sum up a character.

How it does so is a mystery, but we seem to recognise that it does. Murdoch set out her view of love in a number of essays on art and morals.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;font-size: 14.7px;\">In her essay \u2018The Sublime and the Beautiful Revisited\u2019 (1959), Murdoch situates herself in relation to Kant\u2019s aesthetics.

In Murdoch\u2019s alternative, her spectator observes other people. For, she argues, when we become aware of the world as it exists outside our own interests, it is especially the particular that we notice.

We are probably more used to the idea as bearing on morals. In art we are more familiar with the idea that writers and painters must empathise with their characters. Murdoch does not dispute the need for empathy, but (no doubt thinking of her own experience as a novelist) she thinks that it is nonetheless important for fictional characters to be regarded from afar \u2013 to be left free, so to speak, to make their own mistakes, as they stumblingly attempt to apprehend each other\u2019s realities. She again makes the point that when we fail to respect the autonomy of another individual in both art and life, it is because we have been waylaid by convention or self-obsession. Either way, there can too easily be stereotyping or a too-quick summing up: \u201cForm is the temptation of love and its peril\u2026 to round off a situation, to sum up a character.

None of the three ever served more than two customers in the same business hour. If any one had served two customers in the same business hour, the services they rendered are different. \r<br>\r<br>Following are the details of revenue generated by the salon on a given day in different business hours.

However, we know that Bhola has performed one Facial in the morning. It is mentioned that all of them have performed all the services they can perform at least once and at most twice. Thus, the Facial done in the afternoon was done by Ramlal.<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">So, Ramlal has performed 2 Hair Cuts, 1 Head Massage and 1 Shaving in evening and night business hours together. In the evening business hour, only 1 Head Massage was done and it was done by Munna. Thus, Ramlal performed 1 Shaving in the evening and 1 Head Massage in the night respectively.
