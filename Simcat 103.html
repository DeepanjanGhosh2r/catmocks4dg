We are an average member of an especially violent group of mammals, and we&rsquo;ve managed to curb our ancestry. <br \/><br \/><br \/>In the 17th century, he argued that modern society protects us from our brutish nature, lived in &ldquo;continual fear, and danger of violent death. The primates&mdash;the order that includes us, apes, monkeys, and lemurs&mdash;seem to be especially violent. While just 0.3 percent of mammal deaths are caused by members of the same species, that rate rose to 2.3 percent in the common ancestor of primates, and dropped slightly to 1.8 percent in the ancestor of great apes. That&rsquo;s the lethal legacy that humanity inherited. <br \/><br \/><br \/>That isn&rsquo;t to imply determinism. Even within the apes, chimps are notably more aggressive than bonobos, which suggests that group-wide capacities for violence can be tempered by other factors. And history shows that humans have also varied greatly in our violent tendencies. We are influenced by our history, but not saddled to it.<\/p>","PassageTitle":"q1-5","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">The question is based on the second part of the third paragraph.<\/span>\r<br \/><br \/>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1:&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"><b>Correct<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">.

The expected value of a bet (EV) is defined as follows: (probability of winning) \u00d7 (payoff if you win) + (probability of losing) \u00d7 (loss if you lose). The HE of a game is defined as the opposite of the expected value calculated for all possible bets (HE = \u2212EV). <br><br>For example, in European Roulette, a wheel spins and you have to predict where a small ball will land. There are 37 numbered slots (0 to 36). If you bet $1 on one numbered slot (called a straight-up bet), the payoff is 35 times what you bet, and the probability of winning is 1\/37. So the EV of that bet is: (1\/37) \u00d7 $35 + (36\/37) \u00d7 (\u2212$1). That is about \u2212$0.027 or, as a percentage, 2.7 per cent of the initial bet. EV can be read as an average; in our example, you might expect to lose on average $2.70 at every 100 plays with that bet over the long run. This means that European Roulette has a house edge of 2.7 per cent. This is the house\u2019s share of all the income produced by that game in the form of bets over the long run.<br><br>From a player\u2019s point of view, a positive house edge should mean that she can\u2019t make a living off that game: over the long run, the house will have an advantage. That\u2019s why a pragmatic principle of safe gambling behaviour is: \u2018When you make a satisfactory win, take the money and get out of there.\u2019<br><br>Gamblers cultivate a whole spectrum of misconceptions that popularize games of chance. The \u2018gambler\u2019s fallacy\u2019 is the belief that a series of bad plays will be followed by a winning outcome, in order for the randomness to be \u2018restored\u2019. The conjunction fallacy is the idea that the gambler estimates the probability of a combination of events to be higher than the probability of any one of those events. In other words, when someone uses addition rather than multiplication to estimate the probability of two or more mutually independent events. For example, in sports betting, someone might bet once on several \u2018almost sure\u2019 outcomes occurring together, thinking that it\u2019s likely that all the house\u2019s favourite teams will win \u2013 ignoring the fact that the product of the probabilities of several wins is a number significantly lower than the probability of any individual win. Another gambling black hole is the near-miss effect, when an outcome differs just a little from a winning one, which induces the gambler to believe that she was \u2018so close\u2019 that she should try again.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">\u201cThe conjunction fallacy is the idea that the gambler estimates the probability of a combination of events to be higher than the probability of any one of those events.

The brain processes do not explain consciousness. For example when we see the colour red, the brain processes involved in the experience do not explain the experience of red.

The option means: We may be able to understand the processes in the brain while going through an experience.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> <\/span>What is it like to be a bat? This curious question looms large in the history of consciousness studies. First asked in the 1950s, it was made famous by the American philosopher Thomas Nagel in 1974. He used the question to challenge materialism, to explore what we mean by consciousness, and to see why it makes the mind\u2013body problem so intractable. What we mean, he said, is subjectivity. If there is something it is like to be the bat \u2013 something for the bat   itself, then the bat is conscious. If there is nothing it is like to be the bat, then it is not.<br><br>So think, for example, of the mug, or pot, or plastic ornament on your table. Now ask \u2013 what is it like to be the mug? You will probably answer that it is like nothing at all; that mugs cannot feel, that china is inert, and so on. You will probably have no trouble in opining that pots and mugs are not conscious. But move on to worms, \ufb02ies, bacteria, or bats and you may have more trouble. You do not know \u2013 indeed, you cannot know \u2013 what it is like to be an earthworm. Even so, if you think the worm exists then you believe that the worm is conscious.<br><br>Nagel chose the bat as his example because bats are so very different from us. They \ufb02y, live mostly in the dark, hang upside-down from trees or in damp caves, and use sonar, not vision, to see the world. That is, they emit rapid bursts of high-pitched squeaks while they \ufb02y and then, by analysing the echoes that come back to their sensitive ears, learn about the world around them.<br><br>What is it like to experience the world this way? It is no good imagining that you are a bat because an educated, speaking bat would not be a normal bat at all; conversely, if you became a normal bat and could not think or speak then you would not be able to answer your own question.<br><br>There is no generally agreed de\ufb01nition of consciousness, but the following gives some idea of what is meant by the word.<br><br>\u2018What it\u2019s like to be ...\u2019 : If there is something it is like to be an animal (or computer, or baby) then that thing is conscious. Otherwise it is not.<br><br>Subjectivity or phenomenality: Consciousness means subjective experience or phenomenal experience. This is the way things seem to me, as opposed to how they are objectively.<br><br><img src=\"\" data-docx-image=\"\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" \/><br>Qualia: The ineffable subjective qualities of experience, such as the redness of red or the indescribable smell of turpentine. Some philosophers claim they do not exist.<br><br>The hard problem: How do subjective experiences arise from objective brains?<br><br>Nagel argued that we can never know and from this concluded that the problem is insoluble. For this reason he is dubbed a mysterian. Another mysterian is the American philosopher Colin McGinn, who argues that we humans are \u2018cognitively closed\u2019 with respect to understanding consciousness.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1: Not an exception. \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">cognitive<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"> closed\u201d means the human mind is fundamentally incapable.&nbsp;<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 2: Not an exception.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><\/span><br><br>The human desire to create ever bigger and more impressive structures is insatiable. The pyramids of Ancient Egypt, the Great Wall of China and the Burj Khalifa in Dubai are a consequence of pushing engineering to its limits. But huge buildings aren\u2019t just monuments to human ambition: they might hold the key to humanity\u2019s progress in the space-faring age. Proposals are now circulating for a free-standing tower or \u2018space elevator\u2019 that could reach up into the geosynchronous orbit around the Earth. Such a tower would be an alternative to rocket-based transport, and drastically reduce the amount of energy it takes to get into space. <br><br>In recent years, engineers have managed to build on grander scales thanks to the strength and reliability of substances such as novel steel alloys. But as we enter the realm of megastructures \u2013 those of 1,000 km or more in dimension \u2013 maintaining structural integrity will become a fiendish challenge for structures made of any material presently available because the bigger something becomes, the more stress it experiences due to its own weight and shape. (\u2018Stress\u2019 is a measure of mechanical tension, like when you pull something apart from either end, or squeeze it together. \u2018Strength\u2019 is the maximum tension a structure can withstand before it breaks.)<b> <\/b><br><br>It turns out that biological design, equipped with around 3.8 billion years of experience, might help solve this puzzle. Before the age of materials science, engineers had to find their solutions in nature \u2013 wood, leather, stone, weaker metals that could be cast through melting and iron that could only be beaten into shape. But then substances such as steel and concrete arrived, and became successively tougher and lighter, allowing designers to make structures that were much stronger than the maximum possible load they needed to bear. However, once structures turn into megastructures, this risk-averse approach places a cap on their size.<br><br>However, neither the bones nor tendons in our bodies enjoy the luxury of being capable of carrying more than the maximum possible burden. In fact, they\u2019re often compressed and stretched well beyond the point at which their underlying substances begin to break. That is why our bodies constantly repair and recycle their materials. For example, collagen fibres in tendons are replaced in such a way that, while some remain damaged, the overall tendon is safe. This constant self-repair is efficient and inexpensive and can change based on the load. <br><br>Recently, this self-repair paradigm was applied to a possible model of reliable space elevators with available materials. One proposed design features a 91,000 km-long cable (called a tether), extending out from the Equator and balanced by a counterweight in space. The tether would consist of bundles of parallel fibres, similar to collagen fibres in tendons or osteons in bones, but made from Kevlar, a material used to manufacture bullet-proof vests. Using sensors and artificial intelligence, it would be possible to predict when, where and how the fibres would break. And when they do, speedy robotic climbers patrolling up and down the tether will replace them, adjusting the rate of maintenance and repair as needed. Despite operating at very high stress compared to what materials can sustain, we showed this structure would be reliable and would not demand exorbitant rates of replacement. Moreover, the maximum strength the material would need to possess to achieve a dependable structure was cut by 44%.<br>\t<b> <\/b>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>Paragraphs 3 &amp; 4 explain how biological systems work and repair themselves for the damage suffered during functioning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Paragraph 3: \"But then substances such as steel and concrete arrived, and became successively tougher and lighter, allowing designers to make structures that were much stronger than the maximum possible load they needed to bear.

Gita&rsquo;s ticket&nbsp;price is less than that of Esha and Esha did not buy the costliest ticket. So, the maximum possible price of Gita&rsquo;s ticket is Rs.200. Therefore, Gita is not sitting in row-E or F.

Thus, E5, E6, F5, and F6 are the seat numbers occupied by 4 friends in the right block.&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white;\">As 2 seats each in row E and row F are occupied, the arrangement of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 9 will be ruled out.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>From point (h) and (i), Bobby is in row-E and Hetal is in row-F. The price of the tickets of the other 3 persons sitting in the left block is {1050 &ndash; (300 + 250)} = 500. If both Bobby and Hetal sit in aisle seats (i.e., E3 &amp; F3) then one among the other 3 in the left block will sit in column-2 and the other two will sit in column-3. The seats will be C3 (Rs.&nbsp;150), D2 (Rs.&nbsp;200), and G3 (Rs.&nbsp;150). This results in occupying 3 consecutive seats in column-3 (E3, F3, and G3). This violates point (g). Thus, exactly one of Bobby and Hetal&nbsp;has to sit in column-2 and the other will occupy column-3, and the other 3 friends will sit in column-3.<\/p>\n<p>According to point (j), Indu and Faizal cannot sit on the right block. They sit in the aisle seats of the left block. As Indu sits ahead of Faizal, Indu&rsquo;s seat number is C3 and Faizal&rsquo;s seat number is G3. Gita&rsquo;s ticket price is less than that of Esha and Esha did not buy the costliest ticket. So, the maximum possible price of Gita&rsquo;s ticket is Rs.200. Therefore, Gita is not sitting in row-E or F. The only possible position that Gita has is aisle seat in row-D i.e., D3.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, we can say that &ndash; Indu sits in C3, Gita sits in D3, Bobby sits in E2, Hetal sits in F3, and Faizal sits in G3. <br \/>According to point (i), Dinesh and Esha did not buy the costliest ticket.

As they are sitting in 5 rows and each row has an odd number of friends, therefore, two different sitting&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white;\">arrangements<\/span>&nbsp;are possible: (1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 9) or (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 9)<\/p>\n<p>From point (d) and (e), we can say that out of 4 people sitting in the right block, 2 are sitting in&nbsp;column 5 and 2 are sitting in column 6, and the total price of these 4 tickets is Rs.&nbsp;1100. Thus, E5, E6, F5, and F6 are the seat numbers occupied by 4 friends in the right block.&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white;\">As 2 seats each in row E and row F are occupied, the arrangement of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 9 will be ruled out.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>From point (h) and (i), Bobby is in row-E and Hetal is in row-F. The price of the tickets of the other 3 persons sitting in the left block is {1050 &ndash; (300 + 250)} = 500. If both Bobby and Hetal sit in aisle seats (i.e., E3 &amp; F3) then one among the other 3 in the left block will sit in column-2 and the other two will sit in column-3. The seats will be C3 (Rs.&nbsp;150), D2 (Rs.&nbsp;200), and G3 (Rs.&nbsp;150). This results in occupying 3 consecutive seats in column-3 (E3, F3, and G3). This violates point (g). Thus, exactly one of Bobby and Hetal&nbsp;has to sit in column-2 and the other will occupy column-3, and the other 3 friends will sit in column-3.<\/p>\n<p>According to point (j), Indu and Faizal cannot sit on the right block. They sit in the aisle seats of the left block. As Indu sits ahead of Faizal, Indu&rsquo;s seat number is C3 and Faizal&rsquo;s seat number is G3. Gita&rsquo;s ticket price is less than that of Esha and Esha did not buy the costliest ticket. So, the maximum possible price of Gita&rsquo;s ticket is Rs.200. Therefore, Gita is not sitting in row-E or F. The only possible position that Gita has is aisle seat in row-D i.e., D3.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, we can say that &ndash; Indu sits in C3, Gita sits in D3, Bobby sits in E2, Hetal sits in F3, and Faizal sits in G3.<\/p>\n<p>According to point (i), Dinesh and Esha did not buy the costliest ticket.

        <ol>
            <li>Use only the latest version of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge</li>
            <li>The browser window width should be 1200 pixels or higher. Your current browser window width is <span id="currentWindowWidth"></span> pixels.<br>
                Maximize the browser screen and check again if it's not already maximized.

                In case your PC does not support the required resolution, decrease the zoom level of the browser by
                pressing Control and - (minus) buttons on your keyboard till you see the content properly.</li>
