With advances in machine learning, they could spot patterns that humans could not hope to see. Not only was this approach producing consistent results every time the same set of facts were presented, given the vast volumes of data these systems could process, their ability to accurately establish recidivism risk was far better than any human could hope to deliver.<br \/><br \/>That said, algorithmic sentencing is not perfect. The fact of the matter is that algorithms build their models on historical data sets, precedents that are themselves the outcome of decades of choices made by humans who are far from objective.

Thus, in &lsquo;Punctuality&rsquo; and &lsquo;Subject knowledge&rsquo; they received 5 points in total. It may be (2 + 3) or (1 + 4) in some order. But, Bhola did not rate any of his students with 1 rating point in these two parameters. So, it has to be (2 + 3) in some order. Bhola has not rated any of his students with 3 points in &lsquo;Subject knowledge&rsquo; parameter. Thus, Durga as well as Meenakshi received 3 points in &lsquo;Punctuality&rsquo;, and 2 points in &lsquo;Subject knowledge&rsquo;. <br \/><br \/>Durga received a higher rating in &lsquo;Self motivation&rsquo; than &lsquo;Subject knowledge&rsquo; parameter. So, Durga received 4 points in &lsquo;Self motivation&rsquo;, and 1 point in &lsquo;Intelligence&rsquo;. Therefore, Meenakshi received 1 point in &lsquo;Self motivation&rsquo; and 4 points in &lsquo;Intelligence&rsquo;.

Now using (a), we can conclude that Ananya received 3 in &lsquo;Self motivation&rsquo; and 5 points in &lsquo;Intelligence&rsquo;. Thus, Indira and Parvati received 5 points each in &lsquo;Punctuality&rsquo;. <br \/><img style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_343539927_image4.png\" data-docx-image=\"image4.png\" \/> <br \/>Parvati and Ananya have different ratings in the &lsquo;Self motivation&rsquo; parameter.

He conducts private tuition classes at his residence. There are five students in one of his batches. The names of the students are Durga, Indira, Parvati, Meenakshi, and Ananya. Bhola has used a five point scale (minimum 1 point, maximum 5 points) to rate his students on four parameters viz. &lsquo;Punctuality&rsquo;, &lsquo;Subject knowledge&rsquo;, &lsquo;Self motivation&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Intelligence&rsquo;. Rating of 1 represents &lsquo;Poor&rsquo; performance and rating of 5 represents &lsquo;Very Good&rsquo; performance in a parameter.<br \/><br \/>The following table with Tally marks shows the frequency distribution of ratings for the four parameters used (E.g., two students have been rated with 5 points in &lsquo;Punctuality&rsquo; category as according to Bhola, they were Very Good in terms of punctuality).<br \/><br \/><img style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_1859068374_image1.png\" data-docx-image=\"image1.png\" \/><br \/>It is also known that:<br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">a)<\/span> No student got the same<span style=\"color: #000000;\"> rating in any two parameters.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">b)<\/span> No two students got the same<span style=\"color: #000000;\"> ratings in all four parameters.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">c)<\/span> Durga and Meenakshi got the lowest possible value when all four ratings were<span style=\"color: #000000;\"> added.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">d)<\/span> The sum of rating values of &lsquo;Punctuality&rsquo; and &lsquo;Subject knowledge&rsquo; is equal to sum of rating values of the other two parameters for both Durga and Meenakshi.<br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">e)<\/span> Durga received a higher rating in &lsquo;Self motivation<span style=\"color: #000000;\">&rsquo; than &lsquo;Subject knowledge&rsquo; parameter.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">f)<\/span> Ananya received a lower <span style=\"color: #000000;\">rating in &lsquo;Punctuality&rsquo; than &lsquo;Intelligence&rsquo; parameter.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">g)<\/span> Parvati and Ananya have different ratings in &lsquo;Self motivation<span style=\"color: #000000;\">&rsquo; <\/span>parameter<span style=\"color: #000000;\">.<\/span><\/p>","PassageTitle":"q5-10","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">No student got the same rating in any two parameters. Thus, the lowest possible value when all four ratings area added = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = 10<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/>The sum of rating values of \u2018Punctuality\u2019 and \u2018Subject knowledge\u2019 is equal to sum of rating values of the other two parameters for both Durga and Meenakshi. Thus, in \u2018Punctuality\u2019 and \u2018Subject knowledge\u2019 they received 5 points in total. It may be (2 + 3) or (1 + 4) in some order. But, Bhola did not rate any of his students with 1 rating point in these two parameters. So, it has to be (2 + 3) in some order.  Bhola has not rated any of his students with 3 points in \u2018Subject knowledge\u2019 parameter. Thus, Durga as well as Meenakshi received 3 points in \u2018Punctuality\u2019, and 2 points in \u2018Subject knowledge\u2019.\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Durga received a higher rating in \u2018Self motivation\u2019 than \u2018Subject knowledge\u2019 parameter. So, Durga received 4 points in \u2018Self motivation\u2019, and 1 point in \u2018Intelligence\u2019. Therefore, Meenakshi received 1 point in \u2018Self motivation\u2019 and 4 points in \u2018Intelligence\u2019. The other 3 students (Indira, Parvati, Ananya) received 4 points rating in \u2018Subject knowledge\u2019 parameter.<\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">We represent the above points in a tabular format as follows:<\/span>\r<br \/><img src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_343539927_image3.png\" data-docx-image=\"image3.png\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Now, we are left with one Unsatisfactory, one Satisfactory and one Very Good rating in the \u2018Intelligence\u2019 parameter. Ananya received a lower rating in \u2018Punctuality\u2019 than \u2018Intelligence\u2019 parameter. Thus, Ananya definitely received 2 points in \u2018Punctuality\u2019. Now using (a), we can conclude that Ananya received 3 in \u2018Self motivation\u2019 and 5 points in \u2018Intelligence\u2019. Thus, Indira and Parvati received 5 points each in \u2018Punctuality\u2019.<\/span>\r<br \/><img src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_343539927_image4.png\" data-docx-image=\"image4.png\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Parvati and Ananya have different ratings in the \u2018Self motivation\u2019 parameter.
