Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\">The cholera pandemic of the 1830s hit France hard. It wiped out nearly 3% of Parisians in a month. The end of the plague prompted an economic revival, with France following Britain into an industrial revolution. But the pandemic also contributed to another sort of revolution. The city\u2019s poor, hit hardest by the disease, fulminated against the rich, who had fled to their country homes to avoid contagion. France saw political instability for years afterwards. Today, even as covid-19 rages across poorer countries, the rich world is on the threshold of a post-pandemic boom. As vaccinations reduce hospitalizations and deaths, governments are loosening rules on social mixing. America\u2019s economy is projected to grow by around 7% this year.  Other countries are also in for unusually fast growth. <\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\">History suggests that, following periods of massive non-financial disruption such as wars and pandemics, GDP does tend to bounce back. But it offers three further lessons. First, while people are keen to get out and spend, uncertainty lingers for some time. Second, the pandemic encourages people and businesses to try new ways of doing things. Third, political upheaval often follows, with unpredictable economic consequences.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\">Take consumer spending first. Evidence from earlier pandemics suggests that during the acute phase people behave as they have during the past year of covid-19: accumulating savings as spending opportunities vanish. \u2026 History also offers a guide to what people do once life gets back to normal. Spending rises, prompting employment to recover, but there is not much evidence of bacchanalian excess. The popular notion that <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\">people<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\"> celebrated the end of the Black Death \u2026 is probably apocryphal. \u2026 That extra spending certainly pushed the post-war boom along, though the government\u2019s monthly \u201cbusiness situation\u201d reports in the late 1940s were nonetheless filled with worry of an impending slowdown, and indeed the economy went into recession in 1948-49. <\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\">The second big lesson from post-pandemic booms relates to the \u201csupply side\u201d of the economy. Though, in aggregate, people appear to be less keen on frivolous fun following a pandemic, some may be more willing to try new ways of making money. \u2026 <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\">Indeed<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\"> a study for America\u2019s National Bureau of Economic Research, published in 1948, found that the number of startups boomed from 1919.

Months later, the same technology powered the two fastest vaccine trials in the history of science.<\/span><br \/><br \/>Like so many breakthroughs, this apparent overnight success was many decades in the making. More than 40 years had passed between the 1970s, when a&nbsp;Hungarian scientist&nbsp;pioneered early mRNA research, and the day the first authorized mRNA vaccine was administered in the United States, on&nbsp;December 14, 2020. In the interim, the idea&rsquo;s long road to viability nearly destroyed several careers and almost bankrupted several companies.<br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">The dream of mRNA medicines persevered in part because its core principle was tantalizingly simple, even beautiful: The world&rsquo;s most powerful drug factory might be inside all of us.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">People rely on proteins for just about every bodily function; mRNA&mdash;which stands for<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">messenger ribonucleic acid<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">&mdash;tells our cells which proteins to make. With human-edited mRNA, we could theoretically commandeer our cellular machinery to make just about any protein under the sun. You could mass-produce molecules that occur naturally in the body to repair organs or improve blood flow. Or you could request our cells to cook up an off-menu protein, which our immune system would learn to identify as an invader and destroy.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">In the case of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, mRNA vaccines send detailed instructions to our cells to make its distinctive &ldquo;spike protein.&rdquo; Our immune system, seeing the foreign intruder, targets these proteins for destruction without disabling the mRNA. Later, if we confront the full virus, our bodies recognize the spike protein again and attack it with the precision of a well-trained military, reducing the risk of infection and blocking severe illness.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">But mRNA&rsquo;s story likely will not end with COVID-19: Its potential stretches far beyond this pandemic. This year, a team at Yale patented a similar RNA-based technology to vaccinate against&nbsp;malaria perhaps the world&rsquo;s most devastating disease. Because mRNA is so easy to edit, Pfizer says that it is planning to use it against&nbsp;seasonal flu, which mutates constantly and kills hundreds of thousands of people around the world every year. The company that partnered with Pfizer last year, BioNTech, is developing individualized therapies that would create on-demand proteins associated with specific tumors to teach the body to fight off&nbsp;advanced cancer. In mouse trials, synthetic-mRNA therapies have been shown&nbsp;to slow and reverse&nbsp;the effects of multiple sclerosis. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fully convinced now even more than before that mRNA can be broadly transformational,&rdquo; &Ouml;zlem T&uuml;reci, BioNTech&rsquo;s chief medical officer said. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">&ldquo;In principle, everything you can do with protein can be substituted by mRNA.&rdquo;<\/span><br \/><br \/><em><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">In principle<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">&nbsp;is the billion-dollar asterisk. mRNA&rsquo;s promise ranges from the expensive-yet-experimental to the glorious-yet-speculative.&nbsp;But the past year was a reminder that scientific progress may happen suddenly, after long periods of gestation.<\/span><\/p>","PassageTitle":".","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.7px;\">The passage begins with the history of mRNA research and how mRNA works to combat diseases.

        <ol>
            <li>Use only the latest version of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge</li>
            <li>The browser window width should be 1200 pixels or higher. Your current browser window width is <span id="currentWindowWidth"></span> pixels.<br>
                Maximize the browser screen and check again if it's not already maximized.

                In case your PC does not support the required resolution, decrease the zoom level of the browser by
                pressing Control and - (minus) buttons on your keyboard till you see the content properly.</li>
