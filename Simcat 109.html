Even after Europeans realized that Columbus was mistaken, the name stuck. Thus. the native people of the Americas are, collectively, Indians. But the people of the Americas had no collective term for themselves. The various names Native Americans call themselves often can be translated as \u201cThe Real People,\u201d \u201cThe Principal People,\u201d simply \u201cThe People,\u201d or perhaps the people of a particular place.<b> <\/b>\r<br>\r<br>As each group had its name, it also had its own unique history.

In the Iroquois story, the diving animal spread the mud on the back of a turtle so that Sky Woman, who had fallen through a hole in the sky, could have a dry place to live. The histories of the many Pueblo groups and other societies of the desert Southwest begin with the migration of their ancestors from deep within the earth to a cave or other kind of portal on the surface. The stories told the people who they were and reminded them that the place where they lived was theirs, that it had always been theirs, and that it was the place where they were meant to be.

The Bible, which Europeans believed told the full story of creation, could account for neither America nor American Indians. In the centuries since Columbus, there have been many attempts to explain the peopling of the Western Hemisphere. Unwilling to accept Native creation stories as \u201ctrue,\u201d most scholars have become convinced that the ancestors of American Indians came to America from Asia about 13,000 years ago,  across the Bering Land Bridge, which periodically connected Siberia and Alaska during the last ice age. \r<br>\r<br>The earliest well-documented Paleo-Indian culture is called Clovis, where distinctive spear points were discovered in the 1930s in association with the remains of extinct Pleistocene bison.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><\/span>\r<br>\r<br>In October 1492, Christopher Columbus encountered the native people of a small island in the Caribbean. He thought he was in the East Indies, so it made sense for him to refer to the people he met as \u201clos Indios,\u201d or Indians. Even after Europeans realized that Columbus was mistaken, the name stuck. Thus. the native people of the Americas are, collectively, Indians. But the people of the Americas had no collective term for themselves. The various names Native Americans call themselves often can be translated as \u201cThe Real People,\u201d \u201cThe Principal People,\u201d simply \u201cThe People,\u201d or perhaps the people of a particular place.<b> <\/b>\r<br>\r<br>As each group had its name, it also had its own unique history. Communicated orally from generation to generation, these histories often begin with the creation of the world. The Cherokees, for example, tell of a time when the world was only water until a beetle grabbed some mud and brought it to the surface to make land. In the Iroquois story, the diving animal spread the mud on the back of a turtle so that Sky Woman, who had fallen through a hole in the sky, could have a dry place to live. The histories of the many Pueblo groups and other societies of the desert Southwest begin with the migration of their ancestors from deep within the earth to a cave or other kind of portal on the surface. The stories told the people who they were and reminded them that the place where they lived was theirs, that it had always been theirs, and that it was the place where they were meant to be. The stories underscore the distinctiveness of each group and remind us how inadequate it is to think, as Columbus did, of Native Americans collectively. They have become Indians in our thinking, but in reality, they have never been any such thing.\r<br>\r<br>Europeans, once they realized that Columbus\u2019s geography was wrong, were dumbfounded by the idea that two continents of people, perhaps seventy- five million of them, had escaped their notice. The Bible, which Europeans believed told the full story of creation, could account for neither America nor American Indians. In the centuries since Columbus, there have been many attempts to explain the peopling of the Western Hemisphere. Unwilling to accept Native creation stories as \u201ctrue,\u201d most scholars have become convinced that the ancestors of American Indians came to America from Asia about 13,000 years ago,  across the Bering Land Bridge, which periodically connected Siberia and Alaska during the last ice age. \r<br>\r<br>The earliest well-documented Paleo-Indian culture is called Clovis, where distinctive spear points were discovered in the 1930s in association with the remains of extinct Pleistocene bison. Identified by the unique design of spear points and found widely in North America, Clovis represents a hunting culture that exploited Pleistocene animals, especially bison and mammoths, in locations that stretch from coast to coast. While not numerous, Clovis sites are the remains of hunting camps and suggest that people followed their game in small groups over great distances, camping in temporary shelters.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">The hypothesis is : \u201cUnwilling to accept Native creation stories as \u201ctrue,\u201d most scholars have become convinced that the ancestors of American Indians came to America from Asia about 13,000 years ago,  across the Bering Land Bridge, which periodically connected Siberia and Alaska during the last ice age. \u201c  No evidence or details are available in the passage.&nbsp;<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1: Incorrect.

The difference in weight between the tiny goby and the whale shark is a startling eight orders of magnitude. Life on Earth is truly diverse\u2026<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">These massive disparities in animal sizes have fascinated biologists for more than a century. Of course, there are enormous advantages that come with being large. Big animals have an easier time avoiding predators. In large warm-blooded animals, maintaining a constant body temperature is easier due to their better surface-to-volume ratio. And in large herbivores, the larger volume of the intestines leads to more effective fermentation processes, which are needed to break down plant material. It pays to be big.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Indeed, many lineages of animals have vastly increased in size <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">during the course of<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> their evolution. This trend is called Cope\u2019s rule, named after the 19th-century American palaeontologist Edward Drinker Cope. Prominent examples of lineages following Cope\u2019s rule are dinosaurs, which originated from an already sizeable two-metre-long reptile alive in the mid-Triassic (231 million years ago). During the following 165 <\/span>million years, dinosaurs evolved into the largest land animals ever, the Titanosaurs (up to 37 metres long), and the largest land predator ever, the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex.<br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Given all these advantages of a larger body size, an obvious question to ask is: why are not all animal species big? One reason is that species of small animals give rise to new species more rapidly. In a recent theoretical study at the University of the Philippines, we connected the well-established fact that small animals are more numerous (there are more gobies than whale sharks in the ocean) to the insight that larger populations give rise to new species \u2013 a process called speciation \u2013 at a faster rate. Hence, some animal species will evolve towards larger body sizes (following Cope\u2019s rule), but the remaining small species will multiply much more rapidly into new small species, and hence keep <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">the majority of<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> animal species small.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">It is also worth noting that the advantages conferred by large body sizes are dependent on ecological or anatomical conditions. For example, the early lineages of birds in the Mesozoic did not increase in size; flying is notoriously harder with a bigger body. North American freshwater fishes even decreased in size over the course of evolution, perhaps to make it easier for them to invade smaller bodies of water. <\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Another ecological situation that favours smaller body sizes is mass extinction.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><\/span><br><br>Neanderthals died out around 40,000 years ago. But they did not vanish from the Earth entirely. It has become clear in the past decade that Neanderthals mated with the ancestors of modern humans, and produced viable offspring. The upshot is that almost half of the Neanderthal genome still among almost all modern people\u2019s DNA. Such genes have been associated with everything from hairiness to fat metabolism. Many seem to be related to the immune system, and to affect the risk of developing several diseases. <br> <br><br>A pair of recent papers suggest covid-19 belongs on that list as well. The first paper described one Neanderthal DNA string, known as a \u201chaplotype\u201d, that is associated with a higher risk of serious illness. Having one copy of the haplotype, which is found on the third of the 46 chromosomes possessed by humans, doubles the chances of a trip to intensive care. Those unlucky enough to possess two copies\u2014one from each parent\u2014face an even higher risk. That genetic bad luck is not evenly distributed. The gene-sequence is most common among people of South Asian descent, with 63% of the population of Bangladesh carrying at least one copy; and among Europeans, where the prevalence is around 16%. It is virtually absent from Africa and in large swathes of eastern Asia. Exactly what the haplotype does is not clear. One gene within it encodes a protein that interacts with the cellular receptors that SARS-COV-2 (the virus which causes covid-19) uses to enter cells and hijack them. The haplotype is also thought to be involved in the production of signaling proteins, called cytokines, that help to regulate the immune system. An overly aggressive immune response is one mechanism by which covid-19 kills. On the other hand, some of those cytokines protect against cholera. The researchers speculate that may be why the haplotype is common in Bangladesh and India, where cholera has long been a problem. <br><br>The second study concerns another Neanderthal haplotype, found on chromosome 12. Its effect is protective, though less potent: having a single copy is associated with a 22% lower chance of critical illness. It is present in every part of the world except Africa. Between 25% and 50% of the population of Eurasia, Vietnam, eastern China and America carry at least one copy. Scientists also have a better idea of what it does, for it was known to researchers even before the news of its Neanderthal origin. The haplotype hampers the spread of RNA viruses, of which SARS-COV-2 is one, by driving cells infected with them to self-destruct quickly. It is known to provide at least some protection against West Nile virus, hepatitis C and, intriguingly, SARS-COV-1, which caused the SARS outbreak that began in 2002. Once again, the hand of natural selection is visible. The genes in the chromosome-12 haplotype are found in other mammals, and have been lost several times in other species. That hints that carrying them comes at a significant cost, leading them to be removed if they are not being heavily used. That they are common in most human populations suggests RNA viruses have been a thorn in humanity's side for much of its evolutionary history.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>The passage deals with two genetic studies related to covid-19 w.r.t DNA inherited from Neanderthals &ndash; an extinct species of humans.

It has become clear in the past decade that Neanderthals mated with the ancestors of modern humans, and produced viable offspring.

The first paper described one Neanderthal DNA string, known as a \u201chaplotype\u201d, that is associated with a higher risk of serious illness. Having one copy of the haplotype, which is found on the third of the 46 chromosomes possessed by humans, doubles the chances of a trip to intensive care. Those unlucky enough to possess two copies\u2014one from each parent\u2014face an even higher risk. That genetic bad luck is not evenly distributed. The gene-sequence is most common among people of South Asian descent, with 63% of the population of Bangladesh carrying at least one copy; and among Europeans, where the prevalence is around 16%. It is virtually absent from Africa and in large swathes of eastern Asia. Exactly what the haplotype does is not clear. One gene within it encodes a protein that interacts with the cellular receptors that SARS-COV-2 (the virus which causes covid-19) uses to enter cells and hijack them. The haplotype is also thought to be involved in the production of signaling proteins, called cytokines, that help to regulate the immune system.

Scientists also have a better idea of what it does, for it was known to researchers even before the news of its Neanderthal origin. The haplotype hampers the spread of RNA viruses, of which SARS-COV-2 is one, by driving cells infected with them to self-destruct quickly. It is known to provide at least some protection against West Nile virus, hepatitis C and, intriguingly, SARS-COV-1, which caused the SARS outbreak that began in 2002. Once again, the hand of natural selection is visible. The genes in the chromosome-12 haplotype are found in other mammals, and have been lost several times in other species.

Initially, each player was given an integer rating on a scale of 0 to 100 on each of three parameters (Batting, Bowling and Fielding). Then a high rating (above 50) was represented by H and a low rating was represented (50 or below) by L. Accordingly, each player was assigned a 3-letter \u2018All-Rounder Code\u2019 (ARC) with the first letter for batting, the second letter for bowling and the third letter for fielding. (For example, Abraham, who had 64 in batting, 12 in Bowling and 47 in Fielding received the ARC \u201cHLL\u201d while Benjamin, who had 91 in Batting, 42 in Bowling and 78 in Fielding received the ARC \u201cHLH\u201d)<br><br>A similar analysis was carried out in 2020.
