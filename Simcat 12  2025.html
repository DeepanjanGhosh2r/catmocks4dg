In centralized political<span style=\"background-color: white;\"> <\/span>systems (e.g, UK, France), the role of\u00a0bureaucracy in establishing and maintaining state power is generally recognized.

Sentence 1: Following the introduction of competition, this sentence naturally follows as it explains what characteristics define a competitive market. Sentence 3: After defining a competitive market, it's logical to then discuss the potential imperfections or exceptions in such markets, which is what this sentence does.

But if we then move to sentence 4, we're suddenly discussing how competition arises in markets. This information would have been more valuable prior to defining a \"competitive\" market because it sets the groundwork for understanding competition in general before getting into the specifics of what makes a market competitive.

This would make more sense following an explanation of what makes a market competitive (which sentence 1 provides), but it's a bit disjointed coming right after a discussion about how competition arises.

Indraneel can see that some students are standing in front of him and there is no one standing beyond them.<\/p>","PassageTitle":"1-5","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":0,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>Deepanjan can see the front end of the queue. Pradeep can see both&nbsp;Deepanjan and Indraneel. Sumanta can see Pradeep. Nine students who were standing at the rear end of the queue can see Sumanta. Fourteen students are standing in front of Pradeep. Fifteen students are standing in between Sumanta and Pradeep.<br \/>Thus, a total of (9 + 1 + 15 + 1 + 14) = 40 students are standing in the queue. Pradeep is the tallest among all students and Pragyan is standing ahead of Sumanta.<br \/><br \/>Now, exactly eight students are standing in front of&nbsp;Deepanjan. Exactly fourteen students are standing in front of Pradeep. Three students are standing in between&nbsp;Deepanjan and Indraneel. We can derive two cases.<br \/>Case-1: Pradeep (5 students)&nbsp;Deepanjan&nbsp; (3 students) Indraneel&nbsp; (4 students)<br \/>Case-2: Pradeep (1 student) Indraneel&nbsp; (3 students)&nbsp;Deepanjan&nbsp; (8 students)<br \/><br \/>As the smallest value is 3, we can reject&nbsp;case-2. Therefore, Indraneel is shorter than&nbsp;Deepanjan.<br \/><br \/>So, we get the following interim arrangement:<br \/><br \/>[Rear] (9 studs) Sumanta (15 studs) Pradeep (5 studs)&nbsp;Deepanjan (3 studs) Indraneel (4 studs) [Front]<br \/><br \/>Now Pragyan is between Sumanta and Pradeep. Therefore, we need to divide 14 students (other than Pragyan) standing between Sumanta and Pradeep such that the two number are other than 3, 4, 5 and 9. The only possibility is 14 = 8 + 6.<br \/><br \/>Case-1: (9 studs) Sumanta (8 studs) Pragyan (6 studs) Pradeep (5 studs)&nbsp;Deepanjan (3 studs) Indraneel (4 studs)<br \/>Case-2: (9 studs) Sumanta (6 studs) Pragyan (8 studs) Pradeep (5 studs)&nbsp;Deepanjan (3 studs) Indraneel (4 studs)<br \/><br \/>We can conclude that Pragyan is shorter than Sumanta.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<p>Pragyan is shorter than at least two persons viz. Sumanta and Pradeep. Thus, at most 37 students standing in the queue may be shorter than Pragyan in height. <br \/><br \/>Therefore, the required answer is 37.<\/p>","ItemBankID":0,"Difficulty":"Difficult","DifficultyLevel":"512","ItemBank":0,"QuestionPaper":0,"IsProofRead":null,"CorrectIndex":0,"QuestionPaperSectionID":1694167702413,"IsRequiredQuestion":null,"TestID":0,"IsQuestionPackTimer":null,"ItemOptionResponse":[{"ItemOptionID":"169416829686440","ItemID":16941682968644,"Options":"37","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":true,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"169416829686441","ItemID":16941682968644,"Options":"1","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0}],"ItemMatrixSelectedColumns":[],"ItemMatrixResponse":[],"IsPassageQuestionSplit":true,"VideoExplanation":null,"PlayerMode":"S3","VimeoLink":null,"VimeoURI":null,"BookReference":null,"qindex":28,"qsectionindex":1,"qindexbysection":4},{"MaxWords":0,"ItemID":16941682968645,"ItemType":"ne","SubjectName":"Data Interpretation","SubjectID":1589192069884,"AreaName":"Data Interpretation","AreaID":1589192069941,"TopicName":"Bar Graph","TopicID":1597122809878,"SubTopicName":"Calculation","SubTopicID":1597122809933,"ItemOptions":null,"StarRating":null,"ItemBankName":null,"Direction":null,"IsApproved":null,"Items":"What can be the minimum number of categories for which the number of doctors with a specialisation is at least 10?<br><br>Enter your response (as an integer) using the virtual keyboard in the box provided below.<br><br>[quizky-text]","ItemPassageID":16941682968602,"PassageItemIndex":0,"Passage":"<p><strong>Refer to the data below and answer the questions that follow.<\/strong><br \/><br \/>'Sushrusha Hospital' is a multi speciality hospital in Mumbai.
