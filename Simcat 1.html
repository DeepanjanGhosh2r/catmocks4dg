Indeed, <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">a report last year<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> from Gartner, a research and consulting firm, found that roughly half of Millennial shoppers said that they were indifferent to whether a product is brand-name or private-label, and that they would buy more private-label goods if the market provided them.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Retailers like private-label products too\u2014they often have <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">higher profit margins for stores<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> than brand-name goods do. The national grocery chain Kroger has taken a particular liking to them. According to <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">an article from Reuters earlier this year<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">, Kroger has a team of 400 employees who develop its private-label products, poring over sales data to pounce on new trends. Each Kroger store, on average, has more than 15,000 house-brand products, <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">and,<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> the sales of these products accounted for about 27 percent of the chain\u2019s grocery sales last year\u2026<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Private-label products currently account for much larger shares of sales for brick-and-mortar stores than they do for online retailers. According to the market-research firm Nielsen, $17 out of every $100 spent in American brick-and-mortar stores goes to private-label brands, while online, private-label products make up only 3 percent of sales of packaged goods\u2026<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">A spokesperson for Amazon told me that its private-label products \u201conly account for about 1 percent of our total retail sales.\u201d The company does sell a range of products under Amazon-owned brands, but lately it has been focusing on assembling an arsenal of goods that are made by other companies but <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">can\u2019t be purchased anywhere except on Amazon<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">.

Christopher Durham, the private-label consultant, told me a story about working with a retailer on a pack of private-label batteries. Their price was about 60 percent cheaper than what the brand-name version was selling for, but even though Durham said they were of comparable quality, sales were \u201cvery, very slow on them.\u201d He and his team experimented with different <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">prices, and<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> arrived at a somewhat amazing conclusion: \u201cWe could move the price up to about 25 percent less than the national brand, and the [sales] volume went up about seven times.

Pipeline-1 passes through checkpoint <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">C1<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"> and pipeline-2 passes through checkpoint C2. Any pipeline carries petroleum products in integral multiples of 10000 gallons. Total time taken to carry 10000 gallons of petroleum products from A to C1 and C2 to B is the same, which is 10 hours. If an additional volume of output is sent through these two portions of the pipeline, each additional 10000 gallons increases the total transportation time by 30 minutes and 25 minutes from A to C1 and C2 to B respectively. For example, the time taken to carry 20000 gallons of petroleum from A to C1 is 10 hours and 30 minutes and so on.
