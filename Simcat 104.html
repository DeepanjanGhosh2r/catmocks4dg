The passage also mentions the views of Greek philosophers on democracy and forms of government. Option 3 most closely captures these ideas. Since the passage is about Greece, the answer must contain reference to Greece; hence the other options can be eliminated. Option 1 can be eliminated for being too general. The option assumes that the essay is a part of (an introduction to) a larger work which explains &lsquo;democracy as a form of government. Option 2 can be eliminated for the word &lsquo;disadvantages&rsquo; in it. The passage is wider in scope; the difficulties and disadvantages form only about a 3rd of the passage (last paragraph). Option 4 is eliminated as &lsquo;unachievable&rsquo; is not supported.

The best answer lay in finding some middle way: the few ruling with the consent of the many, or 'ruling and being ruled in turn'. And, in any case, rule by the few always needed to placate the many, especially for the defence of the state and the conduct of war. In Athenian terms, someone had to pull the oars of the great trireme war galleys and do so willingly and skilfully; not a job for sullen slaves or time-serving mercenaries but for willing citizens defending their city - or expanding its power aggressively.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1 is incorrect because \u2018economic equality\u2019 was not a feature of Greek democracy; also, fantasy literature is not the main point.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Most of our \u2018knowledge\u2019 about the human brain has come from the study of the mouse brain. A neuroscientist dissects mouse brains, hoping to find out more about their major regions and important structures associated with mental and neurological disorders \u2013 such as autism or epilepsy \u2013 and how to fix them. The knowledge so gained is then applied to treat human patients because the human brain is quite <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">similar to<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> the mouse brain. However, these two species have evolved in different ways, adapting the brain of each for their respective lifestyles and evolutionary niches. This explains why cures in mice <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">don\u2019t<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> always translate into cures for humans. Indeed, our reliance on the mouse has left us with many unanswered questions, such as when the first human neuron fires.<\/span><br><br>While we normally use non-invasive techniques such as ultrasound to visualise the developing foetal brain, we can\u2019t experimentally investigate it at a resolution that allows us to understand it. It is not possible to invasively study a human embryo inside the womb.<br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Neuroscientific research would gain much if researchers could study a human brain that is not inside a human being. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Fortunately<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> in 2008, the Japanese researcher Yoshiki Sasai discovered that it was possible to cultivate artificial human neural tissues outside the womb. So-called \u2018pluripotent\u2019 stem cells <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">have the ability to<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> generate cell types for all tissues in the human body. You can get pluripotent stem cells from the human embryo, or by reprogramming cells from a more developed organism. Sasai has shown that one can guide these cells \u2013 independent of their origin \u2013 to become a neural tissue by exposing them to specific external factors. When suspended in liquid, these neural-committed cells spontaneously self-aggregate, and form small, organized three-dimensional clusters that resemble the anatomic structure of the foetal human brain. We now call these structures \u2018brain organoids\u2019 or \u2018mini-brains\u2019.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">These brain organoids can grow up to 0.5 cm, a pea-sized body of white tissue that you can see with the naked eye. They are kept floating in a juicy, reddish stew that contains all the nutrients the cells need to survive. And, indeed, they can survive for weeks, months and years. Some have even survived three full years \u2013 and it seems they could be kept alive even longer than <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">that, if<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> someone replaces the juice continuously. After keeping brain organoids alive for several months, scientists observed the spontaneous emergence of brain oscillatory waves in them, <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">similar to<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> those detected by electroencephalograms (EEG). These oscillatory waves are ubiquitous in all living human <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">brains, but<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> were never before recorded emerging from any living human-made system. In other words, this simplistic model of the human brain could \u2013 in some ways \u2013 recreate the organized formation of the networks that arise in the womb.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">It <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">shouldn\u2019t<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> be forgotten that brain organoids aren\u2019t actually miniaturized human brains in a dish.
