Only such substantial alterations on a short timescale, the story went, could account for the sudden transformation from 300-pound theropods - a group of two-legged dinosaurs, whose members include the towering Tyrannosaurus rex and the smaller velociraptors - to the sparrow-size prehistoric bird <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Iberomesornis<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">But it has become increasingly clear that the story of how dinosaurs begat birds is much more subtle. Discoveries have shown that bird-specific features like feathers began to emerge long before the evolution of birds, indicating that birds simply adapted a number of pre-existing features to a new use. And recent research suggests that a few simple changes \u2014 among them the adoption of a more babylike skull shape into <\/span>adulthood \u2014 likely played essential roles in the final push to bird-hood. Not only are birds much smaller than their dinosaur ancestors, <span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">they closely<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> resemble dinosaur embryos. Adaptations such as these may have paved the way for modern birds\u2019 distinguishing features, namely their ability to fly and their remarkably agile beaks. The work demonstrates how huge evolutionary changes can result from a series of small evolutionary steps.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">In the 1990s, an influx of new dinosaur fossils from China revealed a feathery surprise. Though many of these fossils lacked wings, they had a panoply of plumage, from fuzzy bristles to fully articulated quills. The discovery of these new intermediary species, which filled in the spotty fossil record, triggered a change in how <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">palaeontologists<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> conceived of the dinosaur-to-bird transition.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">As their recurring success in nature\u2019s designs shows, networks are excellent structures for reliably distributing resources throughout a whole system. In order to better understand the kind of networks that can make us thrive, network theorists studied the branching patterns and resource flows that are found in nature\u2019s ecosystems.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Nature\u2019s networks are structured by branching fractals, ranging from a few larger ones to many medium-sized ones and then myriad smaller ones, just like blood vessels in a body, or veins in a leaf\u2026 Efficiency occurs when a system streamlines and simplifies its resource flow to achieve its aims, say by <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">channelling<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> resources directly between the larger nodes. Resilience, however, depends upon diversity and redundancy in the network, which means that there are ample alternative connections and options in times of shock or change. Too much efficiency makes a system vulnerable, while too much resilience makes it stagnant: vitality and robustness lie in a balance between the two.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">What design principles can nature\u2019s thriving networks teach us for creating thriving economies? In two words: diversity and distribution. If large-scale actors dominate an economic network by squeezing out the number and diversity of small and medium players, the result will be a highly unequal and brittle economy. This certainly sounds familiar, given the current scale of corporate concentration across many industrial sectors, from agribusiness, pharmaceuticals and the media to the banks that are deemed too big to fail.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The fragility generated by such concentration is reviving appreciation for the small, diverse enterprises that make up the bulk of an economy\u2019s network. The question, then, is how to design economic networks so that they distribute value in a far more equitable way.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Thanks to international public outrage over widening inequalities, ambition for greater redistribution has returned in the twenty-first century.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">For more than a century, scientists have been finding hints of a close-knit relationship between the nervous and the immune systems. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, for example, scientists demonstrated that cutting nerves <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">to<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> the skin could curb some hallmarks of inflammation. It wasn\u2019t until the late 1990s that researchers began drawing connections to the body\u2019s master conductor, the brain. Neurosurgeon Kevin Tracey, and his colleagues found something unexpected while investigating whether an experimental anti-inflammatory drug could help to tame brain inflammation caused by stroke.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">When delivered into the brains of rodents that had experienced strokes, the drug had the expected effect: it reduced neuroinflammation. As a control, the team injected the drug into the brains of animals that had inflammation throughout their bodies, thinking the drug would work exclusively in the brain. To their surprise, it also worked in the body\u2026<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">After months of trying to determine the path of the drug from brain to body, the researchers decided to cut the <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">vagus<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> nerve, a bundle of some 100,000 nerve <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">fibres<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> that runs from the brain to the heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and other major organs. With the <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">vagus<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> nerve snipped, the anti-inflammatory effect of the brain-administered drug disappeared.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Inspired by this discovery, Tracey\u2019s group and others have continued to explore other ways in which the <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">vagus<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> nerve \u2014 and the rest of the nervous system \u2014 directs immune responses. Scientific tools have enabled unprecedented charting of interactions between the nervous and immune systems, driving these developments.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Some researchers are focusing on particular body systems. For instance, a team led by Andreas Habenicht, a cardiologist at LMU Munich, reported last year that the interaction between immune cells and nerves in the outermost layer of artery walls modulated the progression of atherosclerosis, an inflammatory disease in which vessels become clogged with cholesterol and other substances.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The brain itself is also beginning to give up its secrets. Neuroscientist Catherine Dulac and her team at Harvard <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">University,<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> have pinpointed neurons in an area called the hypothalamus that control symptoms including fever, warmth-seeking and loss of appetite in response to infection. \u201cMost people probably assume that when you feel sick, it\u2019s because the bacteria or viruses are messing up your body,\u201d she says. But her team demonstrated that activating these neurons could generate symptoms of sickness even in the absence of a pathogen. An open question, Dulac adds, is whether these hypothalamic neurons can be activated by triggers other than pathogens, such as chronic inflammation.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Just above the hypothalamus sits a region called the insula. In a 2021 study, Tamar Koren, found that neurons in the insula store memories of past bouts of gut inflammation \u2014 and that stimulating those brain cells reactivated the immune response. Koren and colleagues suspect that such a reaction might prime the body to fight potential threats. But these reactions could also backfire and start up in the absence of the original trigger. This could be the case for certain conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, that can be exacerbated by negative psychological states.<\/span>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\tOption 1.

But unlike Rousseau or Kant, Hegel put recognition of that moral agency at the center of his account of the human condition. He argued that human history was driven by a struggle for recognition. The demand comes initially from a warrior who is willing to risk his life in a bloody battle, not for territory or wealth, but simply for recognition itself. But this recognition ultimately fails to be satisfying because it is the recognition of a slave, that is, of someone without dignity. This problem can be solved only when the slave acquires dignity through labor, through the ability to transform the world into a place suitable for human life. The only rational form of recognition is ultimately the mutual recognition of master and slave of their shared human dignity.","ItemPassageID":null,"PassageItemIndex":0,"Passage":null,"PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\"><b>Points:<\/b><\/span>\r<br \/><span style='font-family:Wingdings'>\u009f<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">&nbsp;<\/span>\tHegel's link between moral choice and human dignity.\r<br \/><span style='font-family:Wingdings'>\u009f<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">&nbsp;<\/span>\tRecognition of moral agency is central to Hegel's account\r<br \/><span style='font-family:Wingdings'>\u009f<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">&nbsp;<\/span>\tHuman history is driven by a struggle for recognition\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1: This option focuses on the struggle for dignity and the rational form of recognition but misses the idea that human history is driven by the struggle for recognition.<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 2: This option accurately captures the central ideas in the paragraph, including the struggle for recognition driving human history and the only rational form of recognition being the acknowledgement of shared human dignity.<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 3: This option mentions Hegel's belief in moral choice, human dignity, and recognition, but it does not capture the idea of human history being driven by the struggle for recognition and the mutual recognition of shared human dignity as the only rational form of recognition.<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 4: This option connects moral choice and human dignity with the struggle for recognition but does not clearly state that human history is driven by this struggle for recognition, which is central to Hegel's view.<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Hence, [2].<\/span>","ItemBankID":0,"Difficulty":"Medium","DifficultyLevel":"57","ItemBank":0,"QuestionPaper":0,"IsProofRead":null,"CorrectIndex":0,"QuestionPaperSectionID":1696274099101,"IsRequiredQuestion":null,"TestID":0,"IsQuestionPackTimer":null,"ItemOptionResponse":[{"ItemOptionID":"1696274789046210","ItemID":169627478904621,"Options":"Hegel believed that the struggle for recognition is ultimately a struggle for dignity, and that the recognition of our shared human dignity is the only rational form of recognition.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"1696274789046211","ItemID":169627478904621,"Options":"According to Hegel, human history is driven by a struggle for recognition, with the only rational form of recognition being the acknowledgement of shared human dignity.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":true,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"1696274789046212","ItemID":169627478904621,"Options":"Hegel believed human dignity is connected to moral choice, as individuals are morally free agents, and emphasized the role of recognition in human history.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"1696274789046213","ItemID":169627478904621,"Options":"For Hegel, the connection between moral choice and human dignity involves the struggle for recognition culminating in the recognition of shared human dignity of individuals.","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0}],"ItemMatrixSelectedColumns":[],"ItemMatrixResponse":[],"IsPassageQuestionSplit":true,"VideoExplanation":null,"PlayerMode":"VIMEO","VimeoLink":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/874053684\/4bc6cf6ce9","VimeoURI":"\/videos\/874053684?h=4bc6cf6ce9","BookReference":null,"qindex":21,"qsectionindex":0,"qindexbysection":21},{"MaxWords":0,"ItemID":169627478904722,"ItemType":"mcq","SubjectName":"Verbal Ability","SubjectID":1589191865762,"AreaName":"Verbal Reasoning","AreaID":1589191869066,"TopicName":"Summary","TopicID":1589191869123,"SubTopicName":"Summary","SubTopicID":1589191869172,"ItemOptions":null,"StarRating":null,"ItemBankName":null,"Direction":null,"IsApproved":null,"Items":"<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"><\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"><b>The passage given below is followed by four alternate summaries.
