Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><br><br>A lot of medical and clinical thinking about addictive craving is driven by a certain neuroscientific picture that explains cravings in terms of the effects of drugs on the production of dopamine in the brain. On this picture, the object of a craving is a drug itself or the pleasurable effects that getting high is expected to produce. But, by focusing narrowly on the brain, this view misidentifies the object of craving in addiction, or puts too much emphasis on the chemical component. When we look at the social and psychological factors that correlate with addiction, the real object of craving is made salient. In truth, addictive cravings seek out vital emotional experiences. They aim at numbing out, feeling in control, or feeling socially connected. Experiences such as these become particularly valuable and simultaneously elusive under certain environmental conditions\u2026<br><br>One of the most popular dopamine-based explanations of craving focuses on reward-learning\u2026 The mainstream view is that this learning depends on the dopaminergic system. Phasic dopamine is a reward prediction error signal: it signals to us, the difference between the actual amount of reward at a given moment and the amount of reward anticipated. Bursts of dopamine are released when unexpected rewards, or unexpected cues that signal rewards, are encountered. These bursts tell us to act when we come across rewarding objects or related cues in our environment. <br><br>Addictive drugs have a pathological effect on this system. Psychoactive drugs cause artificially high bursts of phasic dopamine to be released by midbrain dopamine neurons. Increased dopamine activity has been observed, for example, with the ingestion of amphetamines, alcohol, nicotine, opiates, cocaine, cannabis and benzodiazepines. When drugs are encountered, dopamine is released in anticipation of reward, but then the drug itself \u2013 due to its chemical effects \u2013 causes an additional dopamine boost when ingested, signalling that the drug is ever increasing in value.

Some customers will be cheaper for the insurer to serve because they make few claims; others more expensive. The market only works if there is a mix of the two. At its worst, selection can push some companies or entire segments of the industry out of business. If an insurance company finds customers are costlier to serve than it expected, it may raise prices. That could deter less risky customers from buying cover at all, leaving the insurer only with the more risky ones. And so the insurer\u2019s costs rise again, and prices increase again, pushing yet more people out.
