Though the territorial arrangements of 1919 to 1921 still left a number of additional nations in East Central Europe stateless and created problems of aggrieved minorities allocated to states toward which they felt little or no affinity, conditions that induced revisionist apologists for the territorial losers of World War I to charge that the territorial arrangements were merely a cynical and unprincipled victors\u2019 fiat, for all their admitted flaws, they still freed three times as many people from nationally alien rule as they subjected to such rule.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The real political weakness of the interwar effort to implement the principle of national self-determination in East Central Europe lay not in its alleged hypocrisy, but in the impossibility of reconciling it with three other important aims of the peacemakers of 1919 to 1921: the permanent diminution of German power, the permanent containment of Russian power, and the permanent restoration of international order in Europe.

In absolute terms, Germany\u2019s industrial and transportation resources had been left largely intact because World War I had not been fought on its territory.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Most species, it turns out, are parasitized by multiple others. Parasites proliferate because every living thing is a smorgasbord of nutrients and energy, and being a top predator isn\u2019t the only way to get a bite of that bounty. Parasites opt out of the arms race between predator and prey entirely, choosing an easier path. It\u2019s clever, when you think about it, and <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">it\u2019s<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> exactly why parasitism is so common. Nature abhors a vacuum. If there\u2019s an opportunity, someone\u2019s going to evolve to fill it.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Parasitism has evolved as a way of life again and again, over billions of years, from the smallest and simplest microbes to the most complex vertebrates.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Yet, we have barely begun to identify all the parasites, much less learn their lifestyles or monitor their populations. One of the things Skylar Hopkins, an ecologist at North Carolina State University, and her colleagues have noticed is what they call the paradox of co-extinction. Since parasites <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">by definition need<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> other species, they\u2019re particularly vulnerable to the phenomenon. Take, for example, the endangered pygmy hog-sucking louse. It lives only on another endangered species, the pygmy hog, which is disappearing from the grasslands it inhabits in the foothills of the Himalaya. Because they\u2019re so sensitive to extinction, it seems likely that many parasite species have already disappeared.<\/span><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"><\/span><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The poster child for parasite conservation, if there is one, is the California condor louse, an ironic victim of the conservation movement itself. In the 1970s, desperate to save the California condor, biologists began rearing the birds in captivity. Part of the protocol was to de-louse every bird with pesticides, on the assumption that parasites were bad for condors, though it\u2019s not clear they <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">actually were<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">. The California condor louse hasn\u2019t been seen since. Untold other parasitic worms, protozoans, and insects are presumed to have gone down with the ship, so to speak, as their hosts died out.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">While the demise of life\u2019s hangers-on might seem like no big deal, or even something to strive for, ecologists caution that wiping them all out would probably spell planetary doom. Without parasites keeping them in check, populations of some animals would explode, just as invasive species do when they\u2019re transplanted away from natural predators. Other species would likely crash in the ensuing <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">mel\u00e9e<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Big, charismatic predators would lose out, too. Many parasites have evolved to move into their next host by manipulating the host they\u2019re in, which tends to drive that host into a predator\u2019s mouth. Nematomorph worms, for instance, mature inside crickets but then need to be in water to mate. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">So<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> they influence the crickets\u2019 brains, driving the insects to jump into streams, where they become an important food source for trout. Similar phenomena feed birds, cats, and other predators the world over.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Even human health wouldn\u2019t entirely benefit from wiping out parasites.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"><\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">In countries such as the United States, where we have eliminated most intestinal parasites, we have autoimmune diseases that are virtually unheard of in places where everyone still has those parasites.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><br><br>Current explanations for why humans dance tend to follow one of two approaches. The first, seen in psychological and some philosophical circles, begins with a human as an individual person who chooses to dance (or not) for entertainment, exercise, artistic <span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">expression<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> or some other personal reason. Such approaches assume that dance is one activity among others offering benefits to an individual that may be desirable, but not necessary, for human wellbeing. Alternatively, a raft of sociological and anthropological explanations <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">focus<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> on community, asserting that dancing is one of the first means by which the earliest humans solidified strong social bonds irrespective of blood lines. In these accounts, dancing is eventually replaced by more rational and effective means of social bonding that the dancing itself makes possible, such as language, <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">morality<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> and religion. While the first type of reasoning struggles to explain why so many humans choose to dance, the second struggles to explain why humans continue to dance. What is missing from these accounts?<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">What if humans are the primates whose capacity to dance (shared by some birds and mammals) was the signature strategy enabling the evolution of a distinctively large and interconnected brain, empathic <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">heart<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> and ecological adaptability? And what if dancing plays this role for humans not just in prehistoric times, but continuing into the present? What if humans are creatures who evolved to dance as the enabling condition of their own bodily becoming?<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Recent evidence for such a thesis is gathering across scientific and scholarly disciplines. Time and again, researchers are discovering the vital role played by bodily movement not only in the evolution of the human species, but in the present-day social and psychological development of healthy individuals. Moreover, it is not just bodily movement itself that registers as vital in these cases, but a threefold capacity: to notice and recreate movement patterns; to remember and share movement patterns; and to mobilise these movement patterns as a means for sensing and responding to whatever appears. This threefold capacity is what every dance technique or tradition exercises and educates.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">According to the New York University neuroscientist Rodolfo <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Llin\u00e1s<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">, bodily movement builds brains. A brain takes shape as it records patterns of neuromuscular coordination, and then remembers the outcomes in terms of pain or pleasure, emotional tags that help it assess whether to mobilise that movement again, and if so, how.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">In so far as bodily movements build the brain, every movement a human makes matters. Each repetition of a movement deepens and strengthens the pattern of mind-body coordination that making that movement requires; and the repetition also defines avenues along which future attention and energy flow. Every movement made and remembered shapes how an organism grows \u2013 what it senses and how it responds. From this perspective, every aspect of a human bodily self \u2013 from chromosomal couplet to sense organ to limb shape \u2013 is a capacity for moving that develops through a process of its own movement making.<\/span><br><br>In this sense, a human being is what I call a rhythm of bodily becoming. A human is always creating patterns of bodily movement, where every new movement unfolds along an open-ended trajectory made possible by movements already made. Dancing can be seen as a means of participating in this rhythm of bodily becoming.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">The last two paragraphs give us some idea about what the author means by \u201crhythm of bodily becoming\u201d. \u201cIn so far as bodily movements build the brain, every movement a human makes matters. Each repetition of a movement deepens and strengthens the pattern of mind-body coordination that making that movement requires; and the repetition also defines avenues along which future attention and energy flow. (simply put, this is most likely referring to evolution) Every movement made and remembered shapes how an organism grows \u2013 what it senses and how it responds.

Production hours are divided into 4 parts: &lsquo;first hour&rsquo; (5 am &ndash; 6 am), &lsquo;second hour&rsquo; (6 am - 7 am), &lsquo;third hour&rsquo; (7 am - 8 am), and &lsquo;fourth hour&rsquo; (8 am - 9 am). The kitchen has only seven production employees (Anu, Baali, Chhottu, Dildaar, Eshan, Fazlul and Giri) who produce only four different types of food items viz. Cake, Bread, Patty and Cookies. Each worker produces only one type of food at the rate of 10 units of finished product in a specific production hour. These seven workers belong to only one of the three different ethnic groups viz. Bengali, Punjabi and Marathi. The following table shows data related to production of food items produced in the kitchen of &lsquo;Tuo Amore&rsquo; on a specific day.

Now, Fazlul can neither be Marathi nor Punjabi. So, we can infer that Anu and Fazlul are Bengali and they produce patty. Thus, Anu didn&rsquo;t work in the 2nd hour. If we assume that no cookies were produced in the first hour then the Punjabi worker, who can produce cookies, did not work in the first hour. In that case, no Punjabi worker worked in the first hour. So, there should be 5 Bengali workers who worked in the first hour. So,&nbsp;Chhottu is the only Marathi worker and there is only one Punjabi worker who produces cookies. Eshan is not a Bengali (point 5). So, Eshan is the only Punjabi worker but he doesn&rsquo;t produce cookies. This is a contradiction. Thus, 20 units of patty and 10 units of cookies were produced in the first production hour.&nbsp; <br \/><br \/>Combining the data in the table (i.e. Marathi employees didn&rsquo;t work in the first and third hours) with point 4, we can say that&nbsp;Chhottu, who is Marathi, produced cakes in the second and fourth production hours.

It produces all the food items to be sold on any given day only from 5 am to 9 am (referred as &lsquo;Production Hours&rsquo;) in its own kitchen. Production hours are divided into 4 parts: &lsquo;first hour&rsquo; (5 am &ndash; 6 am), &lsquo;second hour&rsquo; (6 am - 7 am), &lsquo;third hour&rsquo; (7 am - 8 am), and &lsquo;fourth hour&rsquo; (8 am - 9 am). The kitchen has only seven production employees (Anu, Baali, Chhottu, Dildaar, Eshan, Fazlul and Giri) who produce only four different types of food items viz. Cake, Bread, Patty and Cookies. Each worker produces only one type of food at the rate of 10 units of finished product in a specific production hour. These seven workers belong to only one of the three different ethnic groups viz. Bengali, Punjabi and Marathi. The following table shows data related to production of food items produced in the kitchen of &lsquo;Tuo Amore&rsquo; on a specific day.

In each of the other two production hours exactly 5 employees worked who produced 50 units of finished products. <br \/>Using the information provided in the table, we can create the following product-wise production details: <br \/><img src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_690746418_image2.png\" data-docx-image=\"image2.png\" \/> <br \/>In creating the above table, we need to answer whether any cookies were produced in the first hour of production or not. Now, Fazlul can neither be Marathi nor Punjabi. So, we can infer that Anu and Fazlul are&nbsp;Bengali and they produce patty. Thus, Anu didn&rsquo;t work in the 2nd hour. If we assume that no cookies were produced in the first hour then the Punjabi worker, who can produce cookies, did not work in the first hour. In that case, no Punjabi worker worked in the first hour. So, there should be 5 Bengali workers who worked in the first hour. So,&nbsp;Chhottu is the only Marathi worker and there is only one Punjabi worker who produces cookies. Eshan is not a Bengali (point 5). So, Eshan is the only Punjabi&nbsp;worker but he doesn&rsquo;t produce cookies. This is a contradiction. Thus, 20 units of patty and 10 units of cookies were produced in the first production hour.&nbsp; <br \/><br \/>Combining the data in the table (i.e. Marathi employees didn&rsquo;t work in the first and third hours) with point 4, we can say that&nbsp;Chhottu, who is Marathi, produced cakes in the second and fourth production hours. Therefore, there is one more Marathi worker who produced bread in the second and fourth production hours. <br \/><br \/>From point 6, either&nbsp;Baali worked in 1st and 3rd hours whereas Giri worked in 2nd and 4th hours, or vice-versa. As they produce the same food item, one of them is Punjabi and the other one is Marathi. We have already established that&nbsp;Chhottu, who is Marathi, produced cakes in the second and fourth production hours. So, if any one of Bali or Giri produces cake then the number of units of cake produced in 2nd and 4th hours should be at least 20. But that is wrong.
