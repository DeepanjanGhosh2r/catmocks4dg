This creates a sequence of volcanoes that erupt, grow, then die out as the plate migrates away from the magmatic fuel source. In 1971, the American geophysicist William Jason Morgan proposed that these hot spots were caused by plumes of particularly hot material rising from the lower mantle.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Over the following decades, geophysicists concluded that plumes are around 200 degrees Celsius hotter than the ambient mantle. When plumes reach the base of tectonic plates, their heat melts their surroundings, making plenty of magma. The plumes also carry mantle material up from Earth\u2019s depths. This material melts at the lower pressures found away from the core, feeding additional magma into the crust. The combined supply of hot magma neatly explains a great number of Earth\u2019s intraplate volcanoes.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br>Chains of volcanoes, also known as hot spot tracks, are difficult to explain without invoking plumes.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Back in the 1960s, when the theory of plate tectonics was rapidly gaining acceptance, certain geological features seemed to evade explanation. While the theory provided explanations for questions that had long puzzled scientists \u2014 where volcanoes appear, where land is born, where ocean basins are carved out, where ancient crust was annihilated \u2014 it couldn\u2019t explain something like Hawai\u2019i.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Plate tectonics predicts that the boundaries of tectonic plates \u2014 where two plates collide, slide over or under one another, grind side by side, or move apart \u2014 are where most of the planet\u2019s geologic fireworks can be found. The so-called Ring of Fire, the horseshoe-shaped region that marks the fringes of the many plates surrounding the Pacific plate, is home to 75% of the world\u2019s active volcanoes.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">But despite being nowhere near a plate boundary, Hawai\u2018i is an archipelago of giant volcanoes. The active submarine volcano <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">L\u014d\u2018ihi<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">, off the southeastern shore of the island of Hawai\u2018i, is the youngest member of a warped chain of volcanoes 6,000 <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">kilometers<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> long, one that can be traced all the way to long-expired underwater volcanoes in the northwest Pacific. This phenomenon, known as intraplate volcanism, stood out as a geologic aberration.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In 1963, the Canadian geophysicist John <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Tuzo<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> Wilson suggested that volcanic chains like this are forged when a tectonic plate continuously drifts over a stationary hot spot in the mantle \u2014 the scorching rock that makes up 84% of Earth\u2019s volume. This creates a sequence of volcanoes that erupt, grow, then die out as the plate migrates away from the magmatic fuel source. In 1971, the American geophysicist William Jason Morgan proposed that these hot spots were caused by plumes of particularly hot material rising from the lower mantle.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Over the following decades, geophysicists concluded that plumes are around 200 degrees Celsius hotter than the ambient mantle. When plumes reach the base of tectonic plates, their heat melts their surroundings, making plenty of magma. The plumes also carry mantle material up from Earth\u2019s depths. This material melts at the lower pressures found away from the core, feeding additional magma into the crust. The combined supply of hot magma neatly explains a great number of Earth\u2019s intraplate volcanoes.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br>Chains of volcanoes, also known as hot spot tracks, are difficult to explain without invoking plumes. Hawai\u2018i is an oceanic example, but they can be found on land, too: The Yellowstone <span style=\"color: #000000;\">supervolcano<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> is the youngest member of a hot spot track dating back at least 17 million years, one that poured 210,000 cubic <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">kilometers<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> of lava across the Pacific Northwest before blasting out a trail of giant volcanic cauldrons from Oregon to Wyoming \u2014 the undeniable scar tissue of an unrelenting mantle plume.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Chemical evidence also implies the existence of mantle plumes. There are two stable types of helium: helium-3 and helium-4. Helium-3 was trapped deep within Earth during its formation and is decidedly ancient. Several hot spot volcanoes, including Hawai\u2018i\u2019s <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">K\u012blauea<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">, erupt lavas with an abundance of the stuff. That, said Godfrey Fitton, a petrologist at the University of Edinburgh, suggests that these volcanoes are mining mantle matter from considerable depth \u2014 and a plume is a reasonable explanation.<\/span>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"The argument in the last paragraph is that presence of Helium 3 in the volcanic lavas of intraplate volcanoes makes the mantle plume theory right or \u201cand a plume is a reasonable explanation.\u201d Ring of Fire (second paragraph) is where 75% of the volcanoes (of the plate boundary type) exist.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><br><br><span style=\"color: #040404;\">We are witnessing a world-wide upsurge in memory. Over the last twenty-five years, every country, every social, <\/span><span style=\"color: #040404;\">ethnic<\/span><span style=\"color: #040404;\"> or family group, has undergone a profound change in the relationship it traditionally enjoyed with the past. This change has taken a variety of forms: criticism of official versions of history and recovery of areas of history previously repressed; demands for signs of a past that had been confiscated or suppressed; growing interest in \u201croots\u201d and genealogical research; and a growing attachment to what in the English-speaking world is called \u201cheritage.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #040404;\">This upsurge in memory intersects, with two major historical phenomena, one temporal and one social. The first concerns what is usually referred to as the \u201cacceleration of history\u201d \u2013 an accelerated precipitation of all things into an ever more swiftly retreating past.\u00a0 Broadly speaking, the future could be interpreted in one of three ways, which themselves determined the image people had of the past. It could be envisaged as a form of restoration of the past, a form of progress, or a form of revolution. Today, we have discarded these three ways of interpreting the past, which made it possible to organize a \u201chistory.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #040404;\">We are utterly uncertain as to what form the future will take. We do not know what our descendants will need to know about ourselves <\/span><span style=\"color: #040404;\">in order to<\/span><span style=\"color: #040404;\"> understand their own lives. And this inability to anticipate the future puts us under an obligation to stockpile, as it were, in a pious and somewhat indiscriminate fashion, any visible trace or material sign that might eventually testify to what we are or what we will have become.<\/span><br><br>For the other effect of this \u201cacceleration of history\u201d, symmetrical with that of the future, is to abruptly distance us from the past \u2013 we are cut off from it. It has become what an English demographic historian has famously described as \u201cthe world we have lost\u201d. We are no longer on very good terms with the past. We can only recover it by reconstructing it in monumental detail with the aid of documents and archives; in other words, what we today call \u201cmemory.\u201d<br><br><span style=\"color: #040404;\">The second reason for this outbreak of memory is of a social nature and is linked to what might be called, by analogy with \u201cacceleration\u201d, the \u201cdemocratization\u201d of history. This takes the form of a marked emancipatory trend among peoples, ethnic <\/span><span style=\"color: #040404;\">groups<\/span><span style=\"color: #040404;\"> and even certain classes of individual in the world today; in short, the emergence, over a very short period of time, of all those forms of memory bound up with minority groups for whom rehabilitating their past is part and parcel of reaffirming their identity\u2026<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #040404;\">The explosion of minority memories of this kind has profoundly altered the respective status and the reciprocal nature of history and memory \u2013 <\/span><span style=\"color: #040404;\">or,<\/span><span style=\"color: #040404;\"> to be more precise, has enhanced the very notion of \u201ccollective memory\u201d. Unlike history, which has always been in the hands of the public authorities, of scholars and specialised peer groups, memory has acquired all the new privileges and prestige of a popular protest movement.<\/span>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"The upsurge in memory is a result of two major historical phenomena, one temporal and one social. The first is the \"acceleration of history,\" which refers to the rapid pace at which the present is moving into the past, leaving us increasingly cut off from the past (option 1). This has led to a growing interest in recovering and preserving the past through memory. The second reason for the upsurge in memory is the \"democratization of history,\" which refers to a trend among minority groups to reclaim and celebrate their past as a way of affirming their identity. This has led to a&nbsp;proliferation of diverse memories, which have challenged the traditional dominance of official versions of history and have given rise to the concept of collective memory (Option 3, also makes option 2 the exception) Together, these two phenomena have led to a widespread interest in memory across countries, social, ethnic, and family groups.

The incredibly complicated mechanisms that underlie modern economic life, such as computer parts or television subassemblies, can be produced in the Hong <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Kongs<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> and South Koreas and <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Thailands<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> of the world, using scientific machines operated by men and women just off the paddy fields. From the point of view of imperialism, the upshot of this is a perplexing one. The ability to transplant whole production processes into areas of the world that only yesterday were peasant economies has succeeded to an unprecedented degree in exporting the social institutions of capitalism. Just as the factors of production themselves emerged from a precapitalist social setting during the great economic revolution, so in our times a new economic revolution is bringing the market economy into regions that were formerly only passive, not active forces in the world economy. To that extent, modern imperialism has been a great force for the vitalization of capitalism abroad.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">At the same time, the new imperialism has greatly intensified the competitiveness of the system in its developed homelands. This is not only the result of the interpenetration of each other\u2019s markets that we discussed above, but because the manufacturing outposts of the multinationals in the underdeveloped regions can fire artillery barrages of low-cost commodities back into their motherlands. As no nation knows better than the United States, TV sets made in Hong Kong or Taiwan, or automobiles made in South Korea or assembled in Mexico, can easily undersell the same products manufactured in California or the Midwest.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It is too soon to foretell the consequences of this internationalization and intensification of competition or what may be the outcome of the financial and political crises that have appeared\u2014not surprisingly\u2014in nearly all the Asian \u201ctigers.\u201d What seems beyond doubt is that we have moved in the direction of a global economy in which new world-straddling enterprises coexist uneasily with older national boundaries and prerogatives.

Ltd. is an intra-state courier service provider which promises to deliver any consignment within the state in 24 hours. Geographically the state has two broad geographical divisions or &lsquo;Zones&rsquo; &ndash; North Bengal and South Bengal. WBL has four hubs in North Bengal viz. Hilly, Dooars, Dinajpur, and Malda, and six hubs in South Bengal viz. Murshidabad, Nadia, Central Districts, West Border, Medinipur, and Kolkata (shown in the table). Each hub has 2 to 4 pick &amp; drop points (PDP). The major cities in the respective hubs are considered as PDPs. For example, Kolkata hub has two PDPs &ndash; Kolkata and Howrah. A total of 27 such PDPs exist in the state. <br \/><br \/><img style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_1734141406_image4.png\" data-docx-image=\"image4.png\" \/><br \/><br \/>As per the &lsquo;Policy&rsquo; of the organization, every PDP will be served (i.e. a delivery person will come in a company owned vehicle to drop and pick consignments) at least twice a day &ndash; once in the morning and once in the evening, by the intra-hub vehicle of the respective hub, only. <br \/><br \/>WBL maintains a dedicated inter-hub vehicle for every pair of hubs and one dedicated intra-hub vehicle for each hub.
