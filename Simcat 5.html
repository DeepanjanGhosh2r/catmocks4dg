If, for example, one points to the aesthetic qualities of a work, one must reckon with the fact that aesthetic quality is notoriously difficult to pin down, and that attempts going back to antiquity have failed to give us an objective standard by which to judge. Moreover, aesthetic judgments can easily boil down to individual preferences, which, though perhaps finely attuned to prevailing social norms, are actually the result of particular kinds of education. In other words, it&rsquo;s hard to extricate aesthetic value from cultural &ndash; and aristocratic &ndash; prejudice. <br \/><br \/>One might also justify the judgment of greatness in a book or work of art by pointing to its influence on a tradition of thought or to its impact on how we have come to see the world. In that case, a theoretically sophisticated sceptic might argue that such value judgments point not to anything intrinsic in the work, but to a historically contingent configuration of social power, which, the conscientious critic might add, is inextricable from forms of oppression, exclusion and domination present in our contemporary world. In this critical reading, the elite forms of cultural power embodied in values of &lsquo;greatness&rsquo; are undergirded by the exploitation and dehumanisation of &lsquo;the other&rsquo;. <br \/><br \/>These anti-foundational critiques of &lsquo;greatness&rsquo; carry the high-voltage implication that any hierarchy of artistic value is probably complicit in moral corruption. Up-and-coming scholars who endorse the particular value of certain works, especially canonical ones, do so at their own career-ending peril. In contemporary literary scholarship, it&rsquo;s better to stick to critique &ndash; all the more so when it comes to old books. <br \/><br \/>But without minimising the insights of critical theory, we can contain its paralysing force by eschewing any effort to define a great book &ndash; or a classic &ndash; with reference to some defining essence, whether aesthetic, ideological or historical. We can simply survey the bodies of texts that have come down to us in our few thousand years of written records and note that certain works, and not others, have demonstrated a capacity to illuminate the lives of many different kinds of people in many different historical circumstances. These works somehow transcended the conditions of their own creation &ndash; they spoke within their time, but also beyond it. I don&rsquo;t need to understand much &ndash; or anything, really &ndash; about the political struggles of 14th-century Florence, ubiquitous as they are in Dante&rsquo;s Divine Comedy, to have that work inspire deeper reflection of my own humanity, beginning with its invocation of an individual reaching a crisis point in the life journey we all travel.<\/p>","PassageTitle":"q1-4","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>The passage is suggesting that instead of trying to define or judge a book or work of art by some abstract quality or essence, we can simply look at the historical record and observe which works have had a lasting impact and resonance across different cultures and time periods.

A black hole attracts so strongly that at some point even light\u2014the fastest thing in the universe\u2014cannot escape its pull. The boundary where light becomes trapped is thus a spherical event horizon around the <span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\">center<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\"> of the black hole.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\">Our universe, too, has an event horizon\u2014a fact confirmed by the stunning and unexpected discovery in 1998 that not only is space expanding, but its expansion is <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\">accelerating<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\">. Whatever is causing this speedup has been called dark energy. The acceleration traps light just as black holes <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\">do:<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\"> as the cosmos expands, regions of space repel one another so strongly that at some point not even light can overcome the separation. This inside-out situation leads to a spherical cosmological event horizon that surrounds us, leaving everything beyond a certain distance in darkness.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\">There is a crucial difference between cosmological and black hole event horizons, however. In a black hole, spacetime is collapsing toward a single point\u2014the singularity. In the universe at large, all of space is uniformly growing, like the surface of a balloon that is being inflated. This means that creatures in faraway galaxies will have their own distinct spherical event horizons, which surround them instead of us. Our current cosmological event horizon is about 16 billion light-years away. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\">As long as<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\"> this acceleration continues, any light emitted today that is beyond that distance will never reach us.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\">Cosmologists also speak of a particle horizon, which confusingly is often called a cosmological horizon as well. This refers to the distance beyond which light emitted in the early universe has not yet had time to reach us here on Earth. In our tale, we will be concerned only with the cosmological event horizon, which we will often just call the cosmological horizon. These are unique to universes that accelerate, like ours.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\">The similarities between black holes and our universe don't end there. In 1974 Stephen Hawking showed that black holes are not completely black: because of quantum mechanics, they have a temperature and therefore emit matter and radiation, just as all thermal bodies do. This emission, called Hawking radiation, is what causes black holes to eventually evaporate away. It turns out that cosmological horizons also have a temperature and emit matter and radiation because of a very similar effect\u2026<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\">Hawking's revelation posed a serious problem: if black holes can disappear, so can the information contained within them\u2014which is against the rules of quantum mechanics. This is known as the black hole information paradox, and it is a deep puzzle complicating the quest to combine quantum mechanics and gravity. But in 2019 scientists made dramatic progress. Through a confluence of conceptual and technical advances, physicists argued that the information inside a black hole can <\/span>actually be<span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\"> accessed from the Hawking radiation that leaves the black hole.

Option 2 \u2013 recent conceptual and technical advances have pointed to the retrieval of information from the radiation \u2013 that means it is not incompatible but resolves the paradox.\u00a0 Option 3 is correct.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The paradox was indeed widening the gap between quantum mechanics and gravity as explained above.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Option 4 \u2013 Hawking radiation causes the evaporation and not the paradox.<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Hence, [3].<\/span>","ItemBankID":0,"Difficulty":"Easy","DifficultyLevel":"1669640319437","ItemBank":0,"QuestionPaper":0,"IsProofRead":null,"CorrectIndex":0,"QuestionPaperSectionID":1687500396869,"IsRequiredQuestion":null,"TestID":0,"IsQuestionPackTimer":null,"ItemOptionResponse":[{"ItemOptionID":"1687771541403110","ItemID":168777154140311,"Options":"<span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\">was resolved by the concept of Hawking radiation.<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"1687771541403111","ItemID":168777154140311,"Options":"<span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\">is incompatible with the recent technical advances.<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"1687771541403112","ItemID":168777154140311,"Options":"<span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\"><\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\">made quantum mechanics and gravity irreconcilable.<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":true,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"1687771541403113","ItemID":168777154140311,"Options":"<span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\">causes black holes to eventually evaporate away.<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0}],"ItemMatrixSelectedColumns":[],"ItemMatrixResponse":[],"IsPassageQuestionSplit":true,"VideoExplanation":null,"PlayerMode":"S3","VimeoLink":null,"VimeoURI":null,"BookReference":null,"qindex":11,"qsectionindex":0,"qindexbysection":11},{"MaxWords":0,"ItemID":168777154140312,"ItemType":"mcq","SubjectName":"Verbal Ability","SubjectID":1589191865762,"AreaName":"Reading Comprehension","AreaID":1589191865815,"TopicName":"Inference","TopicID":1589191865872,"SubTopicName":"Inference","SubTopicID":1589191865926,"ItemOptions":null,"StarRating":null,"ItemBankName":null,"Direction":null,"IsApproved":null,"Items":"<span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\"><\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\">According to the passage why was there no nostalgia for the postwar period in North America?<\/span>","ItemPassageID":16877715413984,"PassageItemIndex":0,"Passage":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\"><b>The passage below is accompanied by a set of questions.

In the game, initially eight equidistant chairs numbered 1 to 8 in that order in an anticlockwise direction were placed on a circular track facing outward. Each chair was occupied by exactly one friend. There was a fixed pointer outside the circular track that initially pointed at chair numbered 1. <br \/><br \/>The game proceeded in seven rounds. In each round, the chairs started moving in a clockwise direction on the circular track with uniform speed. After exactly 37 seconds, the chairs stopped moving. If the pointer pointed at any particular chair when the chairs stopped moving, the person occupying that chair was declared 'out' and s\/he had to leave the game. If the pointer pointed between two chairs when the chairs stopped moving, the person who just crossed the pointer (say person A) was 'safe' and the next person to come in front of the pointer was declared 'out' and s\/he had to leave the game. <br \/><br \/>At the beginning of the following round, the chair occupied by the person who was declared 'out' in the previous round was removed and the remaining chairs were symmetrically arranged on the circular track. The numbers on the remaining chairs as well as the persons occupying the remaining chairs remained unchanged. From the second round onwards, initially, before the chairs started moving, they were arranged such that the pointer pointed at the chair occupied by person A (as described in the previous paragraph). In each round, the rate of movement of chairs along the circular track is 6&deg; per second. <br \/><br \/>Thus seven persons were declared 'out'- one in each round. The 8<sup>th<\/sup> person remaining was declared as 'winner' of the game. <br \/><br \/>Further, the following points are known about the chairs initially occupied by the eight friends. <br \/>1.

follow.<\/strong> <br \/><br \/>Eight friends born in eight different cities participated in a game called 'Moving chairs'. In the game, initially eight equidistant chairs numbered 1 to 8 in that order in an anticlockwise direction were placed on a circular track facing outward. Each chair was occupied by exactly one friend. There was a fixed pointer outside the circular track that initially pointed at chair numbered 1. <br \/><br \/>The game proceeded in seven rounds. In each round, the chairs started moving in a clockwise direction on the circular track with uniform speed. After exactly 37 seconds, the chairs stopped moving. If the pointer pointed at any particular chair when the chairs stopped moving, the person occupying that chair was declared 'out' and s\/he had to leave the game. If the pointer pointed between two chairs when the chairs stopped moving, the person who just crossed the pointer (say person A) was 'safe' and the next person to come in front of the pointer was declared 'out' and s\/he had to leave the game. <br \/><br \/>At the beginning of the following round, the chair occupied by the person who was declared 'out' in the previous round was removed and the remaining chairs were symmetrically arranged on the circular track. The numbers on the remaining chairs as well as the persons occupying the remaining chairs remained unchanged. From the second round onwards, initially, before the chairs started moving, they were arranged such that the pointer pointed at the chair occupied by person A (as described in the previous paragraph). In each round, the rate of movement of chairs along the circular track is 6&deg; per second. <br \/><br \/>Thus seven persons were declared 'out'- one in each round. The 8<sup>th<\/sup> person remaining was declared as 'winner' of the game. <br \/><br \/>Further, the following points are known about the chairs initially occupied by the eight friends. <br \/>1. Initially, the pointer pointed at the chair occupied by Ranju. <br \/>2. Bhola and Kaka were sitting adjacent to Ranju. <br \/>3. Dolly was sitting diametrically opposite to Ranju and Titu was sitting diametrically opposite to Gullu. <br \/>4. Kaka was seated third to the left of Gullu. <br \/>5. Sunny was sitting adjacent to both Titu and Dolly. <br \/>6.
