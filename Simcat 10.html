The term azulejo comes from the Arabic word <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">azzelij<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">, meaning \u201clittle polished stone.\u201d The tilework <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">dates back to<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> the 13th century, in the period just after the Moors invaded Portugal and brought parts of their culture to their invaded lands. But it wasn\u2019t until the 16th century that azulejos became a more popular fixture in Portugal. At that time, powerful leaders in the monarchy or church commissioned the mosaics, and production started to take place in-country.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Today, the materials, especially the distinctive blue ink used on the tiles, tend to be sourced from factories in Portugal, and are not readily available elsewhere. First, the tiles are baked in an oven. Then, an artist spreads each individual glaze color made from potent ink diluted with just the right amount of water over a compact powder on the surface of the tile. Once the glaze is applied, each tile is refired in an ultrahot oven that often exceeds 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. It\u2019s this glazing process that makes the tiles particularly resilient, and resistant to elements like rain, <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">sun<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> and fire. That\u2019s also when the true hues reveal themselves and shine.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">\u2026 \u201cOne of the first things to notice is the monumental size of the places with coverings of azulejos,\u201d says Alexandre Pais, the director of the National Azulejo Museum. \u201cThis sense of monumentality is something that is very specific to Portugal.\u201d Other countries certainly use ceramic tiles to decorate walls and buildings, but not to the same extent and in the same deliberate way as in this country. To the untrained eye, azulejos might just seem like geometric shapes and swirling designs assembled and placed onto any old building to decorate an otherwise blank space. But the mosaics are created specifically for the architecture, so, the work\u2019s setting is as critical as the design elements displayed on the tiles\u2026 In other countries, you can remove the tiles and move them from one wall or building to another without losing anything. But in Portugal \u2026 many azulejos have figurative scenes, and they tie into that place and that context.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The other major difference between Portuguese azulejos and other countries\u2019 tilework, Pais says, is that \u201cwe are always changing and adjusting to new concepts, new ideas, according to the aspects of the culture at the time.\u201d In the beginning, azulejos were produced outside of Portugal and tended to feature Islamic motifs like knotwork. Then, in the 16th century, when Portuguese leaders began to commission tileworks and the production of azulejos was localized, \u201ca sense of scenography\u201d took hold\u2026<\/span>\r<br>\r<br>\u2026 Eventually, azulejos were applied to the facades of buildings, especially in Lisbon, as a more manageable, less expensive way of rebuilding the city infrastructure after its infamous earthquake. The artistry, Pais adds, provided a sense of hope in a time of recovery and growth. During the 20th century, contemporary artists began creating original tilework installations in public settings. \u201cIn Portugal, it\u2019s less common to have big sculptures in the center of the square like in Italy or France,\u201d Pais says. \u201cBut what we have is walls covered by azulejos, so azulejos become a vehicle, a medium for contemporary artists to express their individuality.\u201d","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1 is incorrect as azulejo is an art work using tiles and not canvases.

The term azulejo comes from the Arabic word <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">azzelij<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">, meaning \u201clittle polished stone.\u201d The tilework <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">dates back to<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> the 13th century, in the period just after the Moors invaded Portugal and brought parts of their culture to their invaded lands. But it wasn\u2019t until the 16th century that azulejos became a more popular fixture in Portugal. At that time, powerful leaders in the monarchy or church commissioned the mosaics, and production started to take place in-country.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Today, the materials, especially the distinctive blue ink used on the tiles, tend to be sourced from factories in Portugal, and are not readily available elsewhere. First, the tiles are baked in an oven. Then, an artist spreads each individual glaze color made from potent ink diluted with just the right amount of water over a compact powder on the surface of the tile. Once the glaze is applied, each tile is refired in an ultrahot oven that often exceeds 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. It\u2019s this glazing process that makes the tiles particularly resilient, and resistant to elements like rain, <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">sun<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> and fire. That\u2019s also when the true hues reveal themselves and shine.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">\u2026 \u201cOne of the first things to notice is the monumental size of the places with coverings of azulejos,\u201d says Alexandre Pais, the director of the National Azulejo Museum. \u201cThis sense of monumentality is something that is very specific to Portugal.\u201d Other countries certainly use ceramic tiles to decorate walls and buildings, but not to the same extent and in the same deliberate way as in this country. To the untrained eye, azulejos might just seem like geometric shapes and swirling designs assembled and placed onto any old building to decorate an otherwise blank space. But the mosaics are created specifically for the architecture, so, the work\u2019s setting is as critical as the design elements displayed on the tiles\u2026 In other countries, you can remove the tiles and move them from one wall or building to another without losing anything. But in Portugal \u2026 many azulejos have figurative scenes, and they tie into that place and that context.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The other major difference between Portuguese azulejos and other countries\u2019 tilework, Pais says, is that \u201cwe are always changing and adjusting to new concepts, new ideas, according to the aspects of the culture at the time.\u201d In the beginning, azulejos were produced outside of Portugal and tended to feature Islamic motifs like knotwork. Then, in the 16th century, when Portuguese leaders began to commission tileworks and the production of azulejos was localized, \u201ca sense of scenography\u201d took hold\u2026<\/span>\r<br>\r<br>\u2026 Eventually, azulejos were applied to the facades of buildings, especially in Lisbon, as a more manageable, less expensive way of rebuilding the city infrastructure after its infamous earthquake. The artistry, Pais adds, provided a sense of hope in a time of recovery and growth. During the 20th century, contemporary artists began creating original tilework installations in public settings. \u201cIn Portugal, it\u2019s less common to have big sculptures in the center of the square like in Italy or France,\u201d Pais says. \u201cBut what we have is walls covered by azulejos, so azulejos become a vehicle, a medium for contemporary artists to express their individuality.\u201d","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1 is true according to the second paragraph of the passage.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Social scientists distinguish between what are known as treatment effects and selection effects. The Marine Corps, for instance, is largely a treatment-effect institution. It doesn\u2019t have an enormous admissions office grading applicants along four separate dimensions of toughness and intelligence. A modelling agency, by contrast, is a selection-effect institution. You get signed up by an agency because you\u2019re beautiful.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">At the heart of the American obsession with the Ivy League is the belief that schools like Harvard provide the social and intellectual equivalent of Marine Corps basic training\u2014that being taught by brilliant professors and meeting other motivated students and getting a degree with that powerful name on it will confer advantages that no local state university can provide. Fueling the treatment-effect idea are studies showing that if you take two students with the same S.A.T. scores and grades, one of whom goes to a school like Harvard makes far more money ten or twenty years down the road than the other.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">How do we know that two students who have the same S.A.T. scores and grades really are equivalent? It\u2019s quite possible that the student who goes to Harvard is more ambitious and energetic and personable and that those same intangibles are what account for his better career success. To assess the effect of the Ivies, it makes more sense to compare the student who got into a top school with the student who got into that same school but chose to go to a less selective one. Three years ago, the economists Alan Krueger and Stacy Dale published just such a study. And they found that when you compare apples and apples the income bonus from selective schools disappears.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">\u201cAs a hypothetical example, take the University of Pennsylvania and Penn State, which are two schools a lot of students choose between,\u201d Krueger said. \u201cOne is Ivy, one is a state school. Penn is much more highly selective. If you compare the students who go to those two schools, the ones who go to Penn have higher incomes. But let\u2019s look at those who got into both types of schools, some of whom chose Penn and some of whom chose Penn State. Within that set it doesn\u2019t seem to matter whether you go to the more selective school. Now, you would think that the more ambitious student is the one who would choose to go to Penn, and the ones choosing to go to Penn State might be a little less confident in their abilities or have a little lower family income, and both of those factors would point to people doing worse <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">later on<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">. But they don\u2019t.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Krueger notes that students from the lowest economic strata may benefit from attending an Ivy League school, but for most students, being hardworking and intelligent is enough to achieve success regardless of where they go to school. While attending an Ivy League school may offer networking opportunities, a school like Penn State is diverse enough to provide similar advantages. Ultimately, having an Ivy League school on one's resume may open some doors, but if a student was able to gain admission, they likely possess the qualities to succeed regardless of their alma mater.<\/span>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">The correct answer to the question is 1. Choosing a policy intervention, such as a new tax policy or social welfare program based on the impact of the policy intervention, is an example of treatment effect, not selection effect. Treatment effect refers to the effect of an intervention, such&nbsp;<\/span>as a policy or program, on a particular outcome. In contrast, selection effect refers to the process of selecting individuals or groups based on certain characteristics or attributes that may impact the outcome of interest.

It could be that the students who are accepted into Harvard are already more ambitious, energetic, and personable than those who are not accepted.

An echo of that feeling still exists in the respect we citizens of modern democratic societies typically pay to soldiers who die for their country, or firemen who risk their lives. Dignity is not due to everyone, least of all to those whose main objective is to maximize their own welfare. Aristocrats thought of themselves as better than other people and possessed what we may call megalothymia, the desire to be recognized as superior.
