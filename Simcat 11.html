Decades' worth of lab research suggests that birds can sense magnetic fields using magnetoreceptors in their eyes.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\"There's increasing evidence that birds can actually see geomagnetic fields,\" said Morgan Tingley, the paper's corresponding author and a UCLA associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. \"In familiar areas, birds may navigate by geography, but in some situations it's easier to use geomagnetism.\" <\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">But birds' ability to navigate using geomagnetic fields can be impaired when those magnetic fields are disturbed. Such disturbances can come from the sun's magnetic field, for example, particularly during periods of heightened solar activity, such as sunspots and solar flares, but also from other sources. While other factors such as weather likely play bigger roles in causing vagrancy, the researchers found a strong correlation between birds that were captured far outside of their expected range and the geomagnetic disturbances that occurred during both fall and spring migrations. But the relationship was particularly pronounced during the fall migration, the authors noted.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Geomagnetic disturbances affected the navigation of both young birds and their elders, suggesting that birds rely similarly on geomagnetism regardless of their level of migration experience. The researchers had expected that geomagnetic disturbances associated with heightened solar activity would be associated with the most vagrancy. To their surprise, solar activity actually reduced the <\/span>incidence of vagrancy. One possible reason is that radiofrequency activity generated by the solar disturbances could make birds' magnetoreceptors unusable, leaving birds to navigate by other cues instead. \"We think the combination of high solar activity and geomagnetic disturbance leads to either a pause in migration or a switch to other cues during fall migration,\" researchers said. \"Interestingly, birds that migrate during the day were generally exceptions to this rule\u2014they were more affected by solar activity,\u201d they added.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Refer to the last two paragraphs: Solar activity can cause geomagnetic disturbances that impact bird navigation during both fall and spring migrations.

The most recognisable application of learning styles is the notion that visual learners learn best when information is presented visually, auditory learners learn best when listening to recordings, and kinaesthetic learners learn best when engaging in physical or tactile activities.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Learning styles can be seen as something that emerged from a progressive movement that stressed individual differences in children and sought to apply more empirical methods to the study of how learning happens. Developments in personality psychology based on grouping people by the way they relate to the world lent a further scientific plausibility to the learning styles approach.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">By the end of the 20th century, learning styles had become a pedagogical behemoth that fuelled a whole industry of books, workshops, consultants and even government support. Yet, along the way, something went badly wrong as the theory became detached from science and reality. In 2004, when Frank Coffield led a review of the relevant research literature, his team identified an astonishing 71 different learning styles, and they compiled a wide array of associated journal articles, magazine features, websites and conference papers, few of which were peer-reviewed or conducted in well-designed studies.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">With its huge popularity and deep roots in educational reform and psychology, you might wonder what is so problematic about learning styles theory. The first is the validity of the learning styles concept \u2013 that is, whether \u2018learning style\u2019 is a real and specific property of individuals, whereby they learn material better when it is presented to them in a particular modality. And, if it is real, can a learning style actually be measured?<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What learning style tools measure is not a learning style, but rather a learning preference. Someone may prefer to listen to audiobooks as opposed to reading a book. The problem is, there is no evidence that using audio will lead such a person to a better understanding of the content or retention of <\/span>knowledge gained from it. Consider a 2016 study that tested whether visual learners learned better when presented with material in the form of pictures, and whether verbal learners learned better when material was presented as words. Although the visual learners felt more confident when studying pictures and the verbal learners felt more confident studying words, the researchers found no difference in the learning performance of the groups for the different kinds of material. This result and others like it suggest that, even if we accept that individuals have preferences for how they learn, there is no way of assessing their postulated learning style with any accuracy.<br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Learning styles theory suggests that people have discrete groups of learning preferences, but measurement problems suggest that this is not always the case. The effectiveness of learning methods is determined more by the nature of the material being learned than by subjective preferences. For example, visual aids are more effective for learning geography, while auditory aids are more helpful for learning pronunciation in language acquisition.<\/span>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">\u2018If false \u2026 contradicts the passage\u2019<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"> means \u2018<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">which of the following \u2026 supports the passage<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">?\u2019<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The apotheosis of histology, and perhaps the most spectacular revelation in the history of anatomy, came in 1888 when Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal demonstrated the anatomical independence of nerve cells, later termed neurons and defined as the basic units of the brain. Cajal became the first person to use the term <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">plasticity<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> when referring to the central nervous system and its ability to change its structure in response to experience, introducing a concept that has become <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">en<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> vogue<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> in many modern fields, including psychology and education.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Imaging technology in the 21st century is beyond what Cajal and his contemporaries could have imagined, but our desire remains the same. We have preserved the structure of our own enquiry. Gone may be the days of dusty, cork-stopped bottles filled with eerie fluids, of cheap light microscopes, of practising microscopy alone in the kitchen or the attic. Yet cells, no matter how you image them, are still mostly water. Adding colour is still necessary.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The histology of the 19th century has led to a world of unprecedented clarity and vividness, promising immaculate control of complex processes, no longer susceptible to the vagaries of laboratory chemistry. A technique called immunofluorescence, first described in 1942, employs antibodies tagged with fluorescent compounds that reemit light upon excitation and thus function, in the eyes of an observer, like dyes. Another technique, CLARITY renders tissue transparent with monomers called hydrogels, allowing immunofluorescent stains to expose neurons in the whole brain.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A technique known as optogenetics became popular at the start of the 21st century. Instead of chemical reagents, optogenetics relies on photosensitive proteins, or opsins; instead of revealing the structure of cells, the technique tracks their function. With genetic engineering, researchers add new <\/span>code to certain neurons that allows them to make opsins. Then they shine a certain kind of light at those neurons to open their ion channels and fire the electrical signal, thus stimulating their activity. By precisely controlling the processes of the engineered neurons, researchers can observe how other neurons respond, thereby illuminating the brain\u2019s circuitry,<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">carefully and selectively. Already, optogenetics has been used to help patients recover after a stroke and to provide insight into the mechanisms behind anxiety. Scientists hope that their findings will lead to advances in treating Alzheimer\u2019s and PTSD. But, technically optogenetics is a method of <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">perturbing<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> not imaging; the colours are useful only to turn neurons on and off.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The most obvious heir to the spirit of Cajal\u2019s histology is a technique called \u2018<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Brainbow<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u2019, which introduces coral, jellyfish and sea anemone DNA into mice, fruit flies and other small animals. The fluorescent proteins produced as a result are blue, cyan, yellow, orange and red. When mixed, they create a palette of hundreds of distinctive hues. In this collage of vibrant colour, cell bodies appear like neon raindrops. <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Brainbow<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> technique can trace many neurons at once. Neuroscientists these days are more concerned with populations of neurons than they are with individuals.
