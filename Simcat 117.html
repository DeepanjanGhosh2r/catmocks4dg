It would even\u2014whisper it\u2014flummox many professional writers and editors. Yet in England\u2019s national curriculum, it is asked of ten- and eleven-year-olds. So it is surely proven that this sort of teaching helps young people learn to write. <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Right?<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> Wrong. Remarkably, nobody knows whether lessons of the \u201cunderline the relative clause\u201d type do anything to improve pupils\u2019 prose. <\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Children use nouns long before they have ever heard the word \u201cnoun\u201d. They even produce relative clauses when they are about two and a half, a long time before they have heard the word \u201cclause\u201d. No <\/span>wonder that adults\u2014and those writers and editors\u2014can use them too, even skilfully, without having a clue as to how to identify one. Still, grammar is more than just a means to an end. It can be thought of as valuable cultural heritage, as a mode of analytical thinking or as a science, and can help in learning a second language. In fact there is a science of language\u2014linguistics\u2014that touches on all of these elements. But it has hardly any influence in classrooms. Done right, explaining how language works might not only improve writing but bring life to what is otherwise a widely loathed subject.<br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The improvement would first need to reach the teachers. Sadly, grammar instruction for teachers in many Anglophone countries is almost non-existent. In England and America, most English teachers have focused on literature, not language or linguistics, at university. Many literature programmes require some study of language itself, but this might be on poetics or Anglo-Saxon rather than the nuts and bolts of a sentence.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Teachers in England typically do a one-year postgraduate course to qualify to work in state schools. But in these programmes, they may get as little as a single day of grammar instruction\u2014far too little to make up for what they were not taught earlier. So they often approach the task of teaching formal grammar to their charges with trepidation.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">One answer is to make language analysis a requirement in university English courses. It has the virtue of being fascinating. Language is a system, with moving, variable parts. The study of that system includes not only the grammar of Standard English, but how it differs from other languages and from non-standard varieties such as minority dialects.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Armed with such knowledge, teachers could impart grammar not as an onslaught of desiccated definitions or things to underline, but puzzles to solve. Why does \u201cShe destroyed\u201d not feel like a full sentence? How does Shakespeare use \u201cdo\u201d differently from modern writers? Where might you hear \u201cwe <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">was<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201d instead of \u201cwe were\u201d? One study found that adding this kind of analysis made almost 60% of the pupils want to learn more linguistics, particularly language history. Meanwhile the \u201cLinguistics Olympiad\u201d is a popular extra-curricular contest that instils linguistic thinking; perhaps everyone should take part. Getting real language analysis into classrooms would take work. And it may not pay off in better writing\u2014that would have to be tested, too. But that is not the only measure that matters.

The reason is that the molten iron deep inside our planet sloshes around, shifting the magnetic field with it. That has not prevented online tabloids from having an apocalyptic field day. The part that feeds their doomsday scenarios is the possibility that the poles are preparing for another polarity reversal, which would cause a compass to point south instead of north. The quirk is normal \u2014 over the past 20 million years, it has occurred, on average, every 200,000 to 300,000 years.

So, we get 1-5-2. Since sentence 4 continues the idea of the European Union, by likening it to \u2018the Holy Roman Empire\u2019 (reference is to the attempts by the Holy Roman Empire to unify Europe), it comes immediately after the sequence 1-5-2. Placing sentence 3 at the end helps to conclude the paragraph most appropriately-- \u201cthe persistent irony of European history\u201d refers back to the \u2018inadequate alliances\u2019 in spite of the efforts of the Holy Roman Emperor [in the past] and that of the EU [in the present]..

            <li>Use only the latest version of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge</li>
