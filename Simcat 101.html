What if you would not mind having action X done unto you, but someone else would mind it? Most men, for example, are much more receptive toward unsolicited offers of sex than are women. Most men, then, in considering whether to approach a woman with an offer of unsolicited sex, should not ask themselves how they would feel if the roles were reversed. We need to take the Golden Rule one step further, through what I call the ask first principle. <br \/><br \/>There is one surefire test to find out whether an action is right or wrong: ask first. The moral agent should ask the moral recipient whether the behavior in question is moral or immoral. If you aren&rsquo;t sure that the potential recipient of your action will react in the same manner you would react to the moral behavior in question, then ask. Consider an easy test of the ask first principle&mdash;adultery. If you want to know if having an extramarital affair is moral or immoral, ask first the potentially affected moral recipient&mdash;your spouse: &ldquo;Honey, is it okay if I sleep with someone else?&rdquo; You will receive your moral answer swiftly and without equivocation. In this example, as with so many others, you do not actually have to ask the question to know the answer. The thought experiment alone should give you a strong sense of what is right and wrong. <br \/><br \/>Such moral thought experiments are at the heart of moral reasoning. For this process you can monitor your own sense of guilt and other emotions as a guideline. Imagine, in the above example, how you would feel if your partner had slept with someone else. For most people imagining their partners being adulterous is extremely emotionally disruptive. It is not a big leap of the imagination for the moral doer to project that response onto the moral receiver to get an answer to the moral question.<\/p>","PassageTitle":"Q1","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">The assumption that supports the claim that the ask-first strategy would help one be certain about the morality or immorality of any action  is \u201cthe \u2018potential recipient of the action\u2019 knows what is right\u201d.
