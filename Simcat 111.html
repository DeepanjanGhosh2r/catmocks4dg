Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b>\r<br>\r<br>The use of animals for their renewable products greatly increased human capabilities in prehistory. Secondary products \u2013 anything that can be gleaned from a domestic animal repeatedly over its lifetime \u2013 expanded the capabilities of ancient human societies. Apart from their meat, bones and skin, animals gave ancient people vital goods such as their milk and wool. Steady supply of milk from domesticated animals more than doubled the calories in human diet. Wool harvested from sheep allowed humans to keep warm in the colder months, thereby reducing the occurrence of disease and increasing life expectancy.\r<br>\r<br>Studies of the patterns of slaughter of domestic animals according to their age and sex, combined with chemical analyses of the residues left inside ancient pottery vessels, suggest that the consumption of dairy products from sheep, goats and cattle likely dates back into the Neolithic period \u2013 at least 8,000 years ago in Europe (circa 6000 BCE) and earlier in the Near East. The origins of woolly sheep are less well-known. Wild sheep do not have woolly coats, which developed at some point following their domestication. Very few examples of preserved woollen textiles survive for millennia, so the exact date of their production from sheep remains difficult to establish. However, studies of artefacts used in the spinning and weaving of textiles suggest that wool was developed in some regions (such as the Near East) by at least 5,000 or 6,000 years ago. However, even after decades of archaeological research, exactly when humans started using domesticated animals as engines of labour is not well understood.\r<br>\r<br>In the past, investigators generally looked for evidence of items pulled \u2013 primarily (but not only) wagons and ploughs. Wagons \u2013 known from preserved images such as figurines and rock art \u2013 have existed for more than 5,000 years. Early ploughs, such as the ard or scratch plough, were made of wood, and do not preserve well over thousands of years. The oldest known evidence of ploughs in Europe comes from fragments of ards preserved in water-logged ancient sites. They are just under 6,000 years old. Though not nearly as effective as modern tools, early ploughs would have been far faster and easier than breaking compacted earth with hand tools for the purpose of planting crops. They allowed people to plant more crops using less labour and time, increasing the amount of food that could be grown each year.\r<br>\r<br>Pulling heavy loads \u2013 heavier than bodyweight \u2013 causes the medial surfaces of cattle footbones to grow larger, producing a larger surface area over which to distribute the strain. For the past 30 years, many studies have analyzed such changes to cattle footbones found in European archaeological sites dating to 6,000 years ago or later \u2013 in order to identify the nature of changes brought about in the footbones due to the animals\u2019 being used to plough land \u2013 as the oldest known plough existed about 6000 years ago. \r<br>\r<br>In a recent study in the journal Antiquity, we challenged the 4th-millennium dating (6,000 years ago) of the earliest known use of cattle as traction engines in Europe. We studied the footbones of cattle from 11 sites in the western Balkans, dating to the local Neolithic and ranging from 8,000 to 6,500 years ago. Across these sites, cattle footbones from sites of human settlement were compared with the same bones from wild cattle at nearby sites, to determine the presence and absence of footbone alterations indicative of the strain of traction.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Refer to the second paragraph: The origins of woolly sheep are less well-known.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><br>\t<br>\t<br>Just a few years ago, type C hepatitis guaranteed a slow and certain death for many. Available treatments were effective in about half the patients, and the side effects could be awful. Things changed when the drug Harvoni arrived in 2014. With cure rates approaching 99 per cent and far fewer side effects, Havroni sales topped $13.8 billion in 2015.<br><br>But then an odd thing happened \u2013 sales began to drop precipitously. Harvoni, in conjunction with four other hepatitis C drugs, could generate only $4 billion in 2018. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs, the principal reason was that the drug erodes its own market.<br><br>In a memo leaked to news outlets in 2019, the Goldman Sachs analysts cautioned against investing in pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies aiming to develop outright cures, and cite Harvoni as a case study. It\u2019s a simple point to make \u2013 if profit is your goal, then a drug that eradicates a disease and \u2013 thereby \u2013 kills its own demand is not a wise investment.<br><br>Since the overwhelming majority of pharmaceutical development occurs in the \u2018free market\u2019 economies, where privately owned firms act as the force majeure driving progress and the profit motive is what moves private firms, isn\u2019t it but natural that the principles of capitalism \u2013 which have increased efficiency and, thereby, spread prosperity to a previously unimaginable proportion of the masses in many countries \u2013 oppose progress in the pharmaceutical sector beyond a certain point? Should we be surprised that the more unabashed the faith in capitalism is in a country, the more expensive healthcare is in that country?<br><br>But there\u2019s a deeper set of issues surrounding how capitalism distorts the very bedrock of medicine. In a system driven primarily by profit, the development of certain treatments must languish simply because they won\u2019t sell for much. That is why more research is dedicated to how hair can be regrown on the bald head of rich Americans or Europeans than to how poor Africans or Asians can be cured of a dangerous infection.<br><br>In an episode of the popular fictional television series Quincy, aired on March 4, 1981, Jack Klugman played a gritty Los Angeles medical examiner investigating the suicide of a boy with Tourette\u2019s syndrome, a neurological disease that causes uncontrollable tics and verbal outbursts. The show featured Congressional hearings meant to investigate why no drugs were available to treat the disease. In those hearings, fictional representatives from the pharmaceutical industry explained that many diseases, including Tourette\u2019s, were thought to be so rare that there was no financial incentive to develop medications and \u2013 hence \u2013 pharma bosses could not devote their shareholders\u2019 wealth to research cures for such diseases.<br><br>The episode struck a national cord through the US, and Klugman was invited to testify before a real Congressional panel set up to investigate the same issue \u2013 non-existent treatments for rare or \u2018orphan\u2019 diseases. The New York Times featured Klugman\u2019s testimony. Public opinion rallied, and Congress passed the Orphan Drug Act in 1982. The bill introduced large subsidies for development costs, accelerated regulatory approval, and seven years of monopoly for developers of Orphan Drugs within the US. <br><br>The bill paid off.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><br><br>Contemporary society is obsessed with time \u2014 it is the most used noun in the English language. Since clocks with dials and hands first appeared on church towers and town halls, we have been bringing them closer towards us: into our workplaces and schools, our homes, onto our wrists and finally into the phone, laptop and television screens that we stare at for hours each day.<br><br>We discipline our lives by the time on the clock. Our working lives and wages are determined by it, and often our \u201cfree time\u201d is rigidly managed by it too. Broadly speaking, even our bodily functions are regulated by the clock: The fact that there is a strange shame in eating lunch before noon is a testament to the ways in which we have internalized the logic of the clock. We are \u201ctime binding\u201d animals, as the American economist and social theorist Jeremy Rifkin put it in his 1987 book, \u201cTime Wars.\u201d \u201cAll of our perceptions of self and world are mediated by the way we imagine, explain, use and implement time.\u201d<br><br>During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people reported that their experience of time had become warped and weird. Being trapped at home or laboring unusually excessive hours made days feel like hours and hours like minutes, while some months felt endless and others passed almost without notice. It seemed the time in our clocks and the time in our minds had drifted apart. <br><br>Academic studies explored how our emotions (such as pandemic-induced grief and anxiety) could be distorting our perception of time. Or maybe it was just because we weren\u2019t moving around and experiencing much change. After all, time is change, as Aristotle thought \u2014 what is changeless is timeless. But rarely did the clock itself come into question \u2014 the very thing we use to measure time, the drumbeat against which we defined \u201cweird\u201d distortions. The clock continued to log its rigid seconds, minutes and hours, utterly unaware of the global crisis that was taking place. It was stable, correct, neutral and absolute.<br><br>But what makes us wrong and the clock right? \u201cFor most people, the last class they had devoted to clocks and time was early in primary school,\u201d Kevin Birth, a professor of anthropology at the City University of New York who has been studying clocks for more than 30 years, told me recently. \u201cThere\u2019s this thing that is central to our entire society, that\u2019s built into all of our electronics.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Probably the biggest lesson gleaned from the COVID pandemic so far is that being locked up \u2013 whether alone or with family, whether at home or in an unfamiliar place \u2013 stresses people out quite seriously. Mundane routines crush you with the weight of boredom while many cherished habits are suspended. Enclosed, humans tend not to thrive. Isolation can drive us to the brink of madness.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">I\u2019ve been thinking about this problem in relation to SpaceX and its rapid advancements throughout the pandemic, including the most recent successful launch and landing of its largest rocket, Starship. This was a prototype of the ship that Elon Musk <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">intends<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"> to travel to the Moon, to Mars, and eventually beyond. In \u201ccrew mode\u201d it will be able to carry up to 100 passengers. Indeed, Musk suddenly seems a lot closer to his goal of making humans \u201ca multiplanetary species\u201d. There is something vaguely cathartic or even inspiring in Musk\u2019s tenacious drive to perfect the SpaceX Starship especially during the pandemic: it inspires the fantasy of more space, out there, beyond the constraints of Earth. <\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Before SpaceX takes passengers to space, it will offer \u201cEarth to Earth transportation.\u201d These would be ridiculously quick rides around the world. The rocket will take paying travelers above the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, then speed around the globe and land promptly at the destination. From any major urban center with an appropriate landing pad and equipment to service the rocket to another in an antipodal location \u2013 in less than an hour.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">If <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">achieved at<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"> commercial scale, this would turn the airline industry upside down \u2013 or at the very least, it would disrupt the airlines business that rely heavily on long-haul flights. No other airline or aircraft manufacturer is currently developing a similar mode of transit. SpaceX\u2019s Starship flights, if realized, would make even supersonic flights feel like the slow train.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">The rationale for speeding up long flights is that people do not like to be in cramped cabins for more than an hour. The history of commercial aviation has hitherto been a race to shorten the flight <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">time, and<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"> make people more comfortable during flight. However, some things can\u2019t be fixed, like a tarmac delay or an annoying seatmate or constant turbulence. <\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Here is where the paradox enters. The same Starship that will save you all boredom while flying around the earth is also the aspirational repository for Musk\u2019s would-be passengers to Mars. They won\u2019t have a trip in \u201cunder an hour\u201d; they will journey for months at a stretch. If you think air rage is bad on a hop from Las Vegas to San Diego, just wait until your seatmates are there beside you for weeks on end, in the black void of space. SpaceX describes the interior of these craft as including \u201cprivate cabins, large common areas, centralized storage, solar storm shelters and a viewing gallery.\u201d Doesn\u2019t sound bad, right? Still, there\u2019s no getting around the blunt truth of containment \u2013 a whole new purgatory of cramped isolation, <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">en<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"> route and wherever they \u201cland.\u201d <\/span>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<span style=\"font-family: ;\">The passage is about the SpaceX\u2019s Starship and \u201cEarth to Earth transportation\u201d.
