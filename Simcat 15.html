The state can start helping the knowledge commons to realise its potential in five key ways.\r<br>\r<br>First, invest in human ingenuity by teaching social entrepreneurship, problem-solving and collaboration in schools and universities worldwide: such skills will equip the next generation to innovate in open-source networks like no generation before them. Second, ensure that all publicly funded research becomes public knowledge, by contractually requiring it to be licensed in the knowledge commons\u2026. Third, roll back the excessive reach of corporate intellectual property claims in order to prevent spurious patent and copyright applications from encroaching on the knowledge commons. Fourth, publicly fund the set-up of community maker-spaces \u2013 places where innovators can meet and experiment with shared use of 3D printers and essential tools for hardware construction. And lastly, encourage the spread of civic organisations \u2013 from cooperative societies to student groups and innovation clubs\u2013 because their interconnections turn into the very nodes that bring such peer-to-peer networks alive.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"Option 1.

Its presence near the hippo carcasses \u2014 along with another Paranthropus tooth also found at the site \u2014 raises the possibility that it might have been members of Paranthropus, rather than of the modern-human genus Homo, that used some of the stone tools at the site to butcher the animals.<br><br>It isn\u2019t that surprising that other hominin lineages might have made tools, considering that the first known tools pre-date the emergence of Homo. But there is scepticism. \u201cI personally do not believe that Paranthropus made Oldowan tools,\u201d says Mohamed Sahnouni, a palaeolithic archaeologist at the National Research Centre on Human Evolution in Burgos, Spain.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><br><br>Astronomers believe that the Milky Way was preceded by something called a proto-galaxy\u2014a violent, chaotic place containing young stars with wild orbits. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t have a really good idea of what the proto-galaxy looked like,\u201d said\u00a0Vedant Chandra, an astrophysicist at Harvard University and one of the lead authors on a\u00a0recent paper\u00a0detailing the ancient star discoveries.<br><br>By the 2000s, scientists had settled on\u00a0two formation theories. Either the proto-galaxy gave birth to the Milky Way\u2019s first stars internally, as gas coalesced into stars, or it cannibalized other galaxies, ripping out stars and siphoning off dark matter. To settle the question, astronomers would need to isolate the Milky Way\u2019s earliest star population.\u00a0Studies identified\u00a0candidate stars, but if the internal-nursery theory was correct, a much larger fossil population lay undiscovered.<br><br>The opportunity to find them arrived in 2022 when the European Space Agency\u2019s\u00a0Gaia space telescope\u00a0released its third full set of data, called\u00a0DR3. DR3 also included stellar spectra\u2014measurements of how bright a star is at different wavelengths of light. These spectrometry measurements are commonly used to examine the chemical elements inside a star. As the universe ages, hydrogen-rich stars detonate into supernovas and die, spewing out elements such as carbon and oxygen. This material then coalesces into new, heavier-element stars, also known as metal-rich stars. So more recent stars are metal-rich, and metal-poor stars must have originated in the proto-galaxy.<br><br>When the team saw the Gaia DR3 data, however, they were disappointed to discover that the spectrometer readings were too broad to reveal individual chemical peaks. So the team turned to machine learning to extract the signals of heavier elements from the noisy, low-resolution spectra. They used an off-the-shelf algorithm called XGBoost, and trained it using high-quality spectral data from other surveys. The team whittled down a population of 1.5 million stars to about 18,000 early stars with low metallicity located in the Milky Way\u2019s bulge. <br><br>The researchers still needed to answer at least one more question: Where were the proto-galaxy\u2019s stars headed? The answer came from another type of measurement newly available in the Gaia DR3 release\u2014the speed at which the stars are moving along our line of sight. Knowing this velocity made it possible to uncover each star\u2019s orbit. What emerged was a portrait of a halo-shaped proto-galaxy, as anticipated by some theorists. The population of elderly, metal-poor stars orbited in a small, tight sphere with a radius of 9,000 light-years, which the team dubbed the \u201cpoor old heart\u201d of the Milky Way. Overall, the findings suggest that the proto-galaxy didn\u2019t steal stars from other galaxies. If it had, their stellar orbits would be headed toward regions beyond the Milky Way.<br><br>In 2022,\u00a0two\u00a0papers\u00a0hinted at a timeline for the Milky Way\u2019s disk formation. The theory goes that after the proto-galaxy arose, the region \u201csimmered,\u201d collecting gas and creating metal-poor stars. After a billion years, the emergent galaxy \u201cboiled,\u201d frantically giving birth to metal-rich stars for 2 billion to 3 billion years. These newer stars were different. They followed flatter orbits. As the galaxy cooled down, a razor-thin disk formed, filled with the newly minted stars (including our sun) moving in tidy circular orbits around the galactic center.

And yet, most of the time, as Elton pointed out, animals are doing \u2018nothing in particular\u2019. Further research has borne out Elton\u2019s impression. In a study from 1981, researchers found that laziness \u2013 as measured by the percentage of daylight hours spent inactive \u2013 was, in fact, widespread among animals. Lions lie around for three-quarters of the day, as do walruses. Even in bee and ant societies, the classical paragons of hard work, most workers are inactive at any given time. In effect, most animals rest more than they work. Should we now declare that all animals are also affluent, and have limited needs? Not quite. Biologists know that evolution operates with ruthless efficiency, so any apparent laziness we see in animals must serve some kind of function. In the 2010s, researchers found that colonies maintain a pool of inactive workers to step in when new work arises or when other workers get lost, and they sometimes help to store food. Other research has shown that having inactive workers around to replace fatigued workers leads to better long-term success of the colony.","ItemPassageID":null,"PassageItemIndex":0,"Passage":null,"PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\"><b>Points:<\/b><\/span>\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style='font-family:Symbol'>\u00b7<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">&nbsp;<\/span>\tAnimals' central goal is to eat, yet they often appear inactive.\r<br \/><span style='font-family:Symbol'>\u00b7<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">&nbsp;<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Laziness is widespread among animals.<\/span>\r<br \/><span style='font-family:Symbol'>\u00b7<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">&nbsp;<\/span>\tInactivity must serve a function in evolution.\r<br \/><span style='font-family:Symbol'>\u00b7<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">&nbsp;<\/span>\tInactive workers in bee and ant colonies contribute to long-term success.\r<br \/>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1.

The Buenos Aires Cricket League (BACL), is conducting its first player auction for the first edition of the proposed Argentinian Cricket Premier League (ACPL). The players up for auction are divided into two categories &ndash; All-Rounders (AR) and Single-Skill (SS). All AR players can bat as well as bowl, while each SS player either bats or bowls but not both. In each of the skills (i.e., batting and bowling), wherever applicable, the players are given a rating tier (&alpha;, &beta;, &gamma; or &delta;) based on past performances, which will determine their base price at the auction, &alpha; being the highest tier and &delta; the lowest. The following data is known:<br \/><br \/>1. The numbers of SS players who bat and bowl are in the ratio 7 : 5. <br \/>2. No AR player got an &alpha; rating in batting. The number of AR players receiving &beta;, &gamma; and &delta; ratings in batting were in the ratio 1 : 2 : 1 respectively. <br \/>3. Among the batters (i.e., the SS players who bat and all the AR players), exactly \\({1 \\over {4}}^{th}\\) of them got a &beta; rating and \\({1 \\over {8}}^{th}\\) of them got a &delta; rating.

So let us replace x by 4k. <br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 54px; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 72px; text-align: center;\"><strong>AR<\/strong> <\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 84px; text-align: center;\"><strong>SS (Bat)<\/strong> <\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 90px; text-align: center;\"><strong>SS (Bowl)<\/strong> <\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 54px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Bat<\/strong> <\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 72px; text-align: center;\">12k <\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 84px; text-align: center;\">28k <\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 90px; text-align: center;\">0 <\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 54px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Bowl<\/strong> <\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 72px; text-align: center;\">12k <\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 84px; text-align: center;\">0 <\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 90px; text-align: center;\">20k <\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p><br \/>Next let us introduce the ratings. From statement 2 we can figure out the numbers for all rating in the AR (Bat) category. From statement 3, we can figure out the totals of &beta; and &delta; ratings in batting and bowling. This allows us to fill these ratings for SS (Bat) as well. Statement 5 allows us to fill up &delta; for SS(Bowl), while statement 6 allows us to fill &alpha; (and hence &gamma;) for SS(Bat). This allows us to fill &delta; for AR (Bowl) as we know the total &delta; for bowling.

In a similar way, if the horizontal side of the rectangle measures 8 units then it implies that the company had spent Rs. 1,60,00,000 in the year 2021-22.<br><img src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_600613435_image1.jpeg\" data-docx-image=\"image1.jpeg\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" \/><br>Note: Partial coverage of the smallest squares of the graph should be considered as half unit.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":0,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>Using the graph we create the following data represented in tabular format: <br \/><br \/><img style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_303260063_image1.png\" data-docx-image=\"image1.png\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>Therefore, we can derive the following cost, revenue, and profit figures for these six companies in the year 2022-23 as shown below:<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 72px;
