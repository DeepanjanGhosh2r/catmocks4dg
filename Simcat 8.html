The concern is that AI labs are racing to create increasingly powerful systems that no one can predict or control. While control and regulation are central to the issue, it is not clear whose they will be. The historian Yuval Harari predicted that AI <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">will<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> result in a stronger class divide within human society, creating a world where those who ride the train of progress will have divine abilities of creation and destruction, while those left behind will face extinction.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The fear reflected in the AI letter stems from the concern that even those who are on the \"train of progress\" will be unable to steer it. The end of capitalism is a serious threat to those in power, including those who develop, own, and control AI. The only choice left will be between a new form of communism and uncontrollable chaos. The new chatbots, as an example of AI, offer a structure of fetishist disavowal where people know they are not talking to real people but are still able to avoid accompanying risks.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The AI letter is an attempt to prohibit the impossible, as it is impossible for humans to participate in a post-human future. Instead of focusing on threats to our freedom and dignity, we should consider what freedom means now. Futurist Ray Kurzweil predicts that we will soon be dealing with \"spiritual\" machines that will surpass human intelligence. The \"post-human\" sciences are about surprise and emergent properties that AI models might acquire for themselves.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Philosopher-engineer Jean-Pierre Dupuy observed that science and technology have undergone an inversion of traditional anthropocentric arrogance. The emerging technology today aims at non-mastery, and the engineer of tomorrow will not be a sorcerer\u2019s apprentice because of his negligence or ignorance, but by choice. Some top scientists believe science has become so risky that it poses the principal threat to humanity's survival, contrary to Descartes's dream of becoming the master of nature. Philosophers who advocate for returning to the mastery of mastery have misunderstood the technology profiled at the horizon.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Creating \"post-humanity\" threatens to strip humanity, nature, and divinity of their meaning and identity.

In short, don\u2019t pursue technology blindly!\r<br \/>Tech-gnosis refers to a worldview that combines technology and spirituality, where technology is seen not just as a tool, but as a mystical force that can reveal hidden truths about the universe and human consciousness.\u00a0 So, the paragraph argues that a world without&nbsp;wonder and meaning would be devoid of any true purpose, and that the creation of properties that seem supernatural would only further complicate traditional concepts of divinity and humanity. Therefore, option 2 is the correct answer. The argument in the last paragraph&nbsp;has to be seen in the \u2018context of the entire passage\u2019 as the question stem suggests. While Yuval Harari suggests that those who control technology will acquire \u201cdivine abilities of creation and destruction,\u2019 the third paragraph states that the \u201c\"post-human\" sciences are about surprise and emergent properties that AI models (or \u2018spiritual machines\u2019) that might acquire for themselves.\u201d Later in the passage the author suggests that \"post-humanity\" threatens to strip humanity, nature, and divinity of their meaning and identity.\u201d This is tech-gnosticism.&nbsp;\r<br \/>\r<br \/>Option 1. Option 1 is incorrect because the passage does not argue that tech-gnostic visions of a post-human world are necessary for humanity to evolve beyond its current limitations. Rather, it expresses concerns about the consequences of such visions.\r<br \/>Option 2 is the correct answer. The passage argues that once we create properties that seem supernatural, gods as we know them will disappear, leaving us to question what, if anything, will be left. This suggests that the creation of such properties will render traditional concepts of divinity and humanity meaningless. In the context of the passage, especially as a continuation of the paragraph before it, it is the best answer.\r<br \/>Option 3 is partially correct, but it does not fully capture the argument presented in the last paragraph, with the emphasis of tech-gnosticism. While the passage argues that a fully controlled existence lacks meaning and wonder, it also goes on to argue that the creation of supernatural-like properties is the main concern.\r<br \/>Option 4 is incorrect because the passage does not argue that the fear of becoming irrelevant and meaningless in a post-human world is unfounded and misplaced. Rather, it acknowledges these concerns and suggests that the creation of supernatural-like properties may exacerbate them.\r<br \/>\r<br \/>Hence, [2].","ItemBankID":0,"Difficulty":"Difficult","DifficultyLevel":"512","ItemBank":0,"QuestionPaper":0,"IsProofRead":null,"CorrectIndex":0,"QuestionPaperSectionID":1691579885201,"IsRequiredQuestion":null,"TestID":0,"IsQuestionPackTimer":null,"ItemOptionResponse":[{"ItemOptionID":"169173788282330","ItemID":16917378828233,"Options":"<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Tech-gnostic visions of a post-human world are necessary for humanity to evolve beyond its current limitations.<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"169173788282331","ItemID":16917378828233,"Options":"<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span>\t<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The creation of supernatural-like properties will render traditional concepts of divinity and humanity meaningless.<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":true,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"169173788282332","ItemID":16917378828233,"Options":"<span style=\"color: #000000;\">A fully controlled existence lacks meaning and wonder, making it a threat to humanity's identity and purpose.<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"169173788282333","ItemID":16917378828233,"Options":"<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The fear of becoming irrelevant and meaningless in a post-human world is unfounded and misplaced.<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0}],"ItemMatrixSelectedColumns":[],"ItemMatrixResponse":[],"IsPassageQuestionSplit":true,"VideoExplanation":null,"PlayerMode":"S3","VimeoLink":null,"VimeoURI":null,"BookReference":null,"qindex":3,"qsectionindex":0,"qindexbysection":3},{"MaxWords":0,"ItemID":16917378828234,"ItemType":"mcq","SubjectName":"Verbal Ability","SubjectID":1589191865762,"AreaName":"Reading Comprehension","AreaID":1589191865815,"TopicName":"Inference","TopicID":1589191865872,"SubTopicName":"Inference","SubTopicID":1589191865926,"ItemOptions":null,"StarRating":null,"ItemBankName":null,"Direction":null,"IsApproved":null,"Items":"<span style=\"color: #323232;\"><\/span>\t<span style=\"color: #323232;\">The first paragraph supports <\/span><span style=\"color: #323232;\">all of<\/span><span style=\"color: #323232;\"> the following inferences about cilia EXCEPT:<\/span>","ItemPassageID":16917378828192,"PassageItemIndex":0,"Passage":"<b>The passage below is accompanied by a set of questions.

As Schumpeter wrote in his 1954 <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">History of Economic Analysis<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">, \u2018In practice we all start our own research from the work of our predecessors, that is, we hardly ever start from scratch. But suppose we did start from scratch, what are the steps we should have to take? Obviously, <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">in order to<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> be able to posit to ourselves any problems at all, we should first have to visualize a distinct set of coherent phenomena as a worthwhile object of our analytic effort. In other words, analytic effort is of necessity preceded by a pre-analytic cognitive act that supplies the raw material for the analytic effort.\u2019 \u2026<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u2026Schumpeter\u2019s concept of pre-analytic vision was inspired by the ideas of sociologist Karl Mannheim whose observation in the late 1920s that, \u2018every point of view is particular to a social situation\u2019 led him to popularise the notion that we each have a \u2018worldview\u2019 which acts as the lens through which we interpret the world. In the 1960s, Thomas Kuhn turned scientific research upside down by pointing out that \u2018scientists work from models acquired through education often without quite knowing or needing to know what characteristics have given these models the status of community paradigms.\u2019 In the 1970s, sociologist Erving Goffmann introduced the concept of \u2018framing\u2019 \u2013 in the sense that each of us views the world through a mental picture frame \u2013 to show that the way we make sense out of our jumble of experience delineates what we can then see.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Pre-analytic vision. Worldview. Paradigm. Frame. These are cousin concepts. What matters more than the one you choose to use is to realise that you have one in the first place, because then you have the power to question and change it. In economics, that\u2019s an open invitation to look afresh at the mental models we employ in describing and understanding the economy. But it is no easy thing to do\u2026 The <\/span>difficulty lies not in the new ideas, but in the old ones which ramify, for those of us brought up as most of us have been, into every corner of our minds.\u2019<br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The possibility of shaking off old mental models is enticing, but the quest for new ones comes with caveats. First, always remember that \u2018the map is not the territory\u2019, as the philosopher Alfred Korzybski put it: every model can only ever be a model, a necessary simplification of the world, and one that should never be mistaken for the real thing. Second, there is no correct pre-analytic vision, true <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">paradigm<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> or perfect frame out there to be discovered. In the deft words of the statistician George Box, \u2018All models are wrong, but some are useful.\u2019 Rethinking economics is not about finding the correct one (because it doesn\u2019t exist), it\u2019s about choosing or creating one that best serves our purpose \u2013 reflecting the context we face, the values we hold, and the aims we have. As humanity\u2019s context, values, and aims continually evolve, so too should the way that we envision the economy.<\/span>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"The main argument in the passage is present in the third paragraph.

Under less stringent conditions, anthropologists tell us, men and women perform their regular tasks under the powerful guidance of universally accepted norms of kinship and reciprocity\u2026 But in an advanced community [\u2026] when men and women no longer work shoulder to shoulder in tasks directly related to survival, the perpetuation of the human animal becomes a remarkable social feat.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">So remarkable, in fact, that society\u2019s existence hangs by a hair. A modern community is at the mercy of a thousand dangers: if its farmers should fail to plant enough crops; if its railroad men should take it into their heads to become bookkeepers; if too few should offer their services as miners, <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">puddlers<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> of steel,\u00a0 and candidates for engineering degrees, industrial life would soon become hopelessly disorganized. Every day the community faces the possibility of breakdown from sheer human unpredictability.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Over the centuries man has found only three ways of guarding against this calamity. He has ensured his continuity by organizing his society around tradition, by handing down the varied and necessary tasks from generation to generation according to custom and usage.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Or society can solve the problem differently. It can use the whip of authoritarian rule to see that its tasks get done.

It never gave rise to that special field of study called \u201ceconomics.\u201d For the economists waited upon the invention of a third solution to the problem of survival - the development of an astonishing arrangement in which society assured its own continuance by allowing <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">each individual<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> to do exactly as he saw fit, provided he followed a central guiding rule. The arrangement was called the \u201cmarket system,\u201d and the rule was deceptively simple: each should do what was to his best monetary advantage. In the market system the lure of gain steered the great majority to his (or her) task.

It is a different approach to organizing economic activity and ensuring the continuation of society compared to other solutions that have been used throughout history, such as command systems or traditional systems. The passage says \"called forth the economists\" because the development of the market system and the central guiding rule of pursuing one's own monetary advantage created a need for a group of people to study and understand this new approach to organizing economic activity. These people, known as economists, dedicated themselves to&nbsp;analyzing and understanding the market system and how it operates. In this sense, the market system \"called forth\" the economists, as it presented a new and complex area of study that required the expertise and attention of these specialized researchers and analysts.\r<br \/>Option 1 summarizes this.
