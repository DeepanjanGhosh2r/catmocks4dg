Alphabet\u2019s Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, and Hollywood filmmaker James Cameron, all invested in Planetary Resources Inc., which raised venture finance with its mission of mining high-value minerals from asteroids, which have almost no gravity when compared to a planet, and refining those minerals into metal foams that could be shot back down to Earth. Deep Space Industries Inc., a rival startup, also had bold plans to exploit asteroids and comets. Though both companies have now been bought out and their projects put into mothballs, the idea of a space mining industry refuses to die.\r<br>\r<br>It\u2019s wonderful that people are shooting for the stars \u2014 but doubters were right about the fundamentals. Space mining won\u2019t get off the ground in any foreseeable future. \r<br>\r<br>Gravity is the factor that rules out most space mining at the outset. Escaping Earth\u2019s gravitational field makes transporting the stuff needed in a mining operation hugely expensive. On Falcon Heavy, the large rocket being developed by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, transporting a payload to the orbit of Mars comes to as little as $5,357 per kilogram \u2014 a drastic reduction in normal launch costs. Still, at those prices just lofting a single half-ton drilling rig to the asteroid belt would use up the annual exploration budget of a small mining company.\r<br>\r<br>Power is another issue. The international space station, with 35,000 square feet of solar arrays, generates up to 120 kilowatts of electricity. That drill would need a similar-sized power plant \u2014 and most mining companies operate multiple rigs at a time. Power demands rise drastically once you move from exploration drilling to mining and processing. Bringing material back to Earth would raise the costs even higher, albeit by a small multiplier. Japan\u2019s Hayabusa2 satellite spent six years and 16.4 billion yen ($157 million) recovering a single gram of material from the asteroid Ryugu and returning it to Earth earlier this month.\r<br>\r<br>What might you want to mine in space? Water has potential as raw material for hydrogen-oxygen fuel that could be used for a return journey to earth. The discovery in October of ice molecules in craters on the Moon intrigued many. But the concentrations of 100 to 412 parts per million are extraordinarily low by terrestrial standards. It is the same with copper wherever its deposits are evidenced.\r<br>\r<br>The more promising commodities are platinum, palladium, gold and a handful of rare related metals. Because of their affinity for iron, these so-called siderophile elements mostly sunk toward the metallic core of our planet early in its history, and are relatively scarce in the Earth\u2019s crust. Estimates of their abundance on some asteroids, such as the enigmatic Psyche 16 beyond the orbit of Mars, suggest concentrations several times higher than can be found in terrestrial mines.\r<br>\r<br>Still, human ingenuity is all about cutting our coat according to our cloth. If such platinum-group metals are going to justify the literally astronomical costs of space mining, they\u2019ll need to count on sustained high prices for the decade or so that would be needed to get such an operation up and to keep it running \u2014 and that sort of situation is all but unheard-of in the materials industry.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\">Option 1: Incorrect.

Actual movement does the same.<br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\">Why does this happen? By being able to practice a response or exercise a part of the brain without having to physically experience a behavior-eliciting stimulus (especially one that is potentially dangerous), we can optimize mental functioning and, ultimately, our response to an actual situation. It is well known that mental imagery techniques greatly facilitate multiple aspects of performance from sports to music.

Also, if this capacity to simulate an environment allows us to be optimally prepared to deal with challenges in a real environment, it should affect fitness and be naturally selected across generations. The threat-simulation hypothesis of dreaming argues that this is the purpose of dreams and the reason why dreaming has evolved. <\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;font-size: 14.7px;\">To evaluate the threat simulation theory of dreaming, it is useful to discuss it in an evolutionary context and consider whether dreaming meets the necessary requirements of evolution by natural selection; namely, genetic variation, inheritance, and differential fitness.

Need for the material to make textile from could have been what triggered one of the greatest changes in the life of humanity: not food but clothing might have led to the agricultural revolution.<br><br>The development of clothing led to innovations with many repercussions beyond survival in cold climates. A need for portable insulation from the cold in the Palaeolithic prompted major technological innovations. These include stone toolkits for working animal hides and, subsequently, bone tools such as pointed awls and needles to make tailored garments. Equipped with effective protection from wind chill, our ancestors could penetrate into the frigid Arctic Circle, further north than comparatively better cold-adapted Neanderthals had managed to venture.<br><br>Early hominins in Africa began to use fire between 1 and 2 million years ago, well before the advent of Homo sapiens. Most probably, to keep wild animals away at night and to soften meat. Not to keep warm. Our species, therefore, has used fire since its first appearance but invented clothing somewhere down the line. Although both could help keep warm, fire could do so indoors only. Out in the open, foraging or hunting or traveling, only clothes could protect prehistoric Homo sapiens from cold, especially from wind chill of the ice age.  Moreover, fitted clothing helps more in cold weather than do simple wrap around ones. They also learned to increase its effectiveness by adding layers. What we don\u2019t know is when.<br><br>Clothes perish rapidly and rarely survive beyond a single millennium. Among the notable exceptions are a pair of 3,000-year-old trousers worn by nomadic horse-riders in Central Asia, and a 5,000-year-old linen tunic from ancient Egypt. We have only a few precious cloth fragments from the early Neolithic, in Peru and Turkey. Just a few twisted flax fibres \u2013 used perhaps to make strings or thread \u2013 has been found at a 34,000-year-old site in Georgia. However, eyed needles made of animal bone are indirect evidence for the existence of fitted clothing. The oldest \u2013 made 50,000 years ago \u2013 have been found in the Denisova cave.<br><br>Scientific efforts to date the origins of clothing have recently received an unexpected boost from the study of clothing lice, or body lice. These blood-sucking insects inhabit clothes and they evolved from head lice when people began to use clothes on a regular basis. Research teams in Germany and the United States analysed the genomes of head and clothing lice to estimate when the clothing parasites split from the head ones. The German team, led by Mark Stoneking at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, came up with a date of 100,000 years ago, early in the last ice age. The US team led by David Reed at the University of Florida reported two dates: one around 80,000 years ago, and another as early as 170,000 years ago, during the ice age before the last.<br><br>However, the genetic analysis of modern clothing lice can inform us only about clothes worn routinely in some human populations up until the present day. Earlier hominins or Homo sapiens themselves could have adopted clothes in colder climate, acquiring clothing lice in the process, and then discarded clothes during warm phases, without leaving any genetic trace in modern-day lice.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>Option 1: Incorrect.

            <li>Use only the latest version of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge</li>
