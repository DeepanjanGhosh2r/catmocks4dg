Choose the best answer for each question.<\/strong><\/span> <br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">It is often said that campus life in university is the best phase of your life. For a number of years, students live and learn in a confined community setting designed to facilitate the pursuit of knowledge. And then, one day, they graduate and face the real world.<\/span> <br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">This model of a confined campus community serves little purpose today. The world is changing so rapidly <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">that students<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\"> entering university today would struggle to make sense of the world they enter upon graduation. That is, unless the campus community is specifically designed to have a porous boundary and be tightly interwoven with the real world. This has become a compelling imperative for universities today. Engaging with the real world through porous boundaries can and must take many forms. Research collaborations and consultations with industry could help maintain the balance between pure and applied research. The faculty could be expanded to include practitioners, such as authors, statisticians, business leaders, conservationists and policymakers. Students could be encouraged to learn experientially, by attempting to identify and solve real-life problems in the world around them.<\/span> <br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">In recent years, virtual reality and augmented reality (VR\/AR) has emerged as an effective enabler of experiential learning. The efficacy of VR\/AR tools for learning has been scientifically established for more than a decade now. However, most prior research has taken place in experimental conditions and controlled lab settings that involve expensive VR\/AR equipment and room facilities. Today, costs associated with VR\/AR have dropped substantially&mdash;you could buy a cardboard VR viewer for under \u20b9500, and view VR\/AR content for free using your <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">smartphone<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">. Universities looking to build a porous boundary with the real world would do well to take a close look at the potential of VR\/AR.<\/span> <br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">The possibilities are endless and exciting, spanning a gamut of disciplines and learner types. In biology, for example, the rote memorization of the names and characteristics of species and genera continues to intimidate the brightest of students. On the other hand, imagine taking a walk through the dense Amazon jungle. You look around, taking in the infinite diversity of plant and animal life around you. You listen to the sounds of the forest. You turn to pay attention to the flitting movement you sense with your peripheral vision, and observe a dazzling blue butterfly. Now, you pause, and click on it. You see that it is the <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">Morpho<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">rhetenor<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">, and learn about how the structural arrangement of the scales covering its wings causes its iridescence.<\/span> <br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">Or perhaps you&rsquo;re a <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">maths<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\"> student trying to break away from Euclidean planes. But hyperbolic planes are hard to comprehend. How could it be that you take four left turns but not end up at the same spot where you started?

This experiment helped the researchers prove that plants have evolved to respond to auditory stimulus in their environment and react to sounds and sweeten up their flowers to facilitate pollination.\u00a0 Option 1 generalises from the specific experiment conducted by the researchers and states the central idea of the passage.\u00a0 Option 2 is wrong in stating that \u201cplants do possess cochlea\u201d; in reality they don\u2019t.

Choose the best answer for each question.<\/strong><\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">It\u2019s a common assumption that auditory information is reserved for living things with ears and that creatures without cochlea\u2014namely plants\u2014don\u2019t tune into a bee buzzing or the wind whistling. But a new study suggests the plants are listening, and some flowers even sweeten up their nectar when they sense a pollinator approaching.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">Sound is ubiquitous; plenty of species have harnessed the power of sound to their evolutionary advantage in some way or another\u2014a wolf howls and rabbits run; a deer hears a thunder strike in the distance and seeks shelter, and birds sing to attract their mates. Plants have withstood the test of time, so logically so, they must react to such a crucial sensory tool as well, right?\u00a0 Since sound is propagated as a wave, it doesn\u2019t always take the complex set of ear bones and hair cells found in mammal ears to detect the presence of sound, just the ability to perceive vibrations.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">To test the idea, Tel Aviv University evolutionary theoretician <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">Lilach<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">Hadany<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\"> and her team looked at the relationship between bees and flowers. The team exposed the beach evening primrose, <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">Oenothera<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">drummondii<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">, to five types of sound: silence, the buzz of a bee from four inches away, and low, intermediate and high pitched sounds produced by a computer, Donahue writes. They then measured the amount of nectar that the flowers produced after being exposed to the sound.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">Blossoms exposed to silence as well as high-frequency and intermediate-frequency waves produced the baseline amount of sugar expected in their nectar. However, the blooms exposed to the bee\u2019s buzz and low-frequency sounds bumped their sugar content up 12 to 20 per cent within three minutes of being <\/span>exposed to the hum. In other words, when they \u201cheard\u201d a bee approaching, they sweetened their nectar.<br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">Perhaps this isn\u2019t too surprising because\u2014although flowers come in all shapes and sizes\u2014so many are actually rather ear-shaped, with petals forming conical or cupped shapes. To make sure the sound is what was triggering the flowers to produce sugar, and not some other factor, they placed the blossoms in a laser <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">vibrometer<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">, which records very small movements, and replayed the sounds.
