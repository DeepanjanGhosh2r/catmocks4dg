While architecture necessarily relied on abstraction to indicate plans and sections, cartography did so to encompass immense scale, representing the earth from a vantage impossible until the invention of flight. Both representational systems relied on the common use of graphical signs, where the signifier is instinctively linked to the signified: the way a line figures a wall on paper, or a pair of sinuous lines indicates a river on a map. Architects embraced chromatic natural signs: red for tiles, how baked they were, or blue for roof slate, which can be found in quarries&hellip;. <br \/><br \/>The shift from an imitative to a conventional use of color in &ldquo;architectural&rdquo; representation at the end of the 17th century occurred in the milieu of French military engineers, precisely because they were a coherent, centralized corps in need of a common graphic language devoid of any ambiguity. Frontier fortification sites were by their nature far from centralized design centers (i.e. large cities like Paris) and the stakes of their design were much higher than in civil architecture: misinterpretation of the design or of the material quality could occasion the fall of the fort, or even the country itself. Consequently, the mar&eacute;chal de Vauban, the head of the corps, wrote extensive instructions detailing which colors his subordinates were to use to convey precise architectural information. The system was so efficient that it was later adopted by architects through manuals of architectural draftsmanship written by military engineers, but also in the private schools of architecture that flourished in the 18th century&hellip; <br \/><br \/>This balance between imitation and convention of course runs through the entire history of color, but in the case of architecture, it offers particular insight into the anxiety of a profession that has always been torn between the world of painters and that of engineers, between art and craft, between aesthetics and science.<\/p>","PassageTitle":"q1-4","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1.

Apart from some specific contexts, the mark evaluates the result rather than the effort, a nuance that is not always well understood. It can be a more or less precise range, from a binary statement of success or failure to a percentage scale and everything in between.<br><br>The other purpose of grading is comparison. The mark given places each \u201cperformance\u201d on a scale that situates it in relation to others, with a desirable but variable degree of accuracy and objectivity. In an ideal world, the grading grid would allow individuals to situate themselves in relation to the group. Nobody likes bad grades: not artists, not restaurants, not students. But bad grades hurt even more when they are used as the basis for decisions made by people other than the one being evaluated: a potential client or viewer, a graduate school admissions committee or a potential employer.<br><br>There\u2019s a clear tension between these two aims of evaluation. Conversely, when it is intended for the person being assessed, the grade alone does not provide sufficiently informative feedback. Grades and their distribution on a curve provide clear, simple and immediately usable information for third parties. Do I have to worry about how third parties receive and use this information? Conversely, when it is intended for the person being assessed, the grade alone does not provide sufficiently informative feedback.<br><br>In responding to Cyr, some argued that awarding a rating out of 10 was not intended for the artists but rather for all those people looking for a way to choose among the many shows on offer. This, in my opinion, is where the jobs of professor and theatre critic part ways. Teachers should avoid worrying too much about the other \u201cusers\u201d of the information conveyed by transcripts. To those of you who devote many hours to reading, evaluating and commenting on papers, theses and other exams, I raise my hat. This will always be the most difficult aspect of your chosen career.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1.\u00a0 While this is a known issue in academic evaluation, the passage doesn't state or imply this.<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 2.

Progressive educators banished the practice from classrooms, dismissing it as a vestige of a less enlightened time.

Committing information to one\u2019s own mind seemed ever less essential. The arrival of the limitless and easily searchable data banks of the Internet brought a further shift, not just in the way we view memorization but in the way we view memory itself.

Ten students have been enrolled in one such coaching batch and Shiva has conducted a class test on five different subjects for these students. The results of the students in this class test have been tabulated by Shiva using a grading system. In the grading system, A, B, C, D, and F grades fetch 8, 6, 4, 2, and 0 grade points respectively. The Grade Point Average (GPA) is the arithmetic mean of the grade points obtained in the five subjects. For example, if a student has received A, A, B, D, and C grades in five different subjects, his or her GPA is \\({(8&nbsp; +&nbsp; 8&nbsp; +&nbsp; 6&nbsp; +&nbsp; 2&nbsp; +&nbsp; 4) \\over {5}}\\) = 5.6.

According to point 3 he must have received grade D in both P.T. and Drawing.&nbsp;Thus he failed in Spelling. <br \/><br \/>Indrajeet's total grade point is 28. According to point 2, we cannot take A + A + A + D (in some order).

Thus, she received grade D in both P.T. and Drawing, and failed in Spelling. <br \/><br \/>Now, we can say that Chahel received grades A and B in Drawing and Spelling in some order. <br \/><br \/>Bobita&rsquo;s total grade point is 16.

Ten students have been enrolled in one such coaching batch and Shiva has conducted a class test on five different subjects for these students. The results of the students in this class test have been tabulated by Shiva using a grading system. In the grading system, A, B, C, D, and F grades fetch 8, 6, 4, 2, and 0 grade points respectively. The Grade Point Average (GPA) is the arithmetic mean of the grade points obtained in the five subjects. For example, if a student has received A, A, B, D, and C grades in five different subjects, his or her GPA is \\({(8&nbsp; +&nbsp; 8&nbsp; +&nbsp; 6&nbsp; +&nbsp; 2&nbsp; +&nbsp; 4) \\over {5}}\\) = 5.6. Only &lsquo;F&rsquo; grade is considered a failing grade. The tabular representation of these ten students&rsquo; grades and their GPAs are shown below (the names of the students in the table have been written in alphabetical order from top to bottom): <br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 83px;

These are as follows: <br \/>1. Faiza did not score grade C in any subject. <br \/>2. Indrajeet did not score grade D twice. <br \/>3. Jagat failed in at most one subject. <br \/>4. Exactly two students have passed in all the subjects. <br \/>5. No student failed (i.e. received &lsquo;F&rsquo; grade) in Science.<\/p>","PassageTitle":"q1-5","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>We calculate the&nbsp;sum total of grade points received by each student by multiplying his\/her GPA with 5. <br \/><br \/>Jagat's total grade point is 16. Sum of his GPs in P.T., Science and Spelling must be 4. According to point 3 he must have received grade D in both P.T. and Drawing.&nbsp;Thus he failed in Spelling. <br \/><br \/>Indrajeet's total grade point is 28. According to point 2, we cannot take A + A + A + D (in some order). We will not be able to fit A + B + B + B as no two vertically consecutive cells contain the same grade. The only option left is B\/C + A + A + C\/B in the order of P.T., Mathematics, Science, and Drawing. Thus, Indrajeet is one such student who passed in all the subjects. <br \/><br \/>Harini's total grade point is 10. She failed in two subjects and received grade D in one subject. Thus, she must have received grade D in Drawing and failed in P.T. and Spelling.&nbsp; <br \/><br \/>Faiza's total grade point is 28.&nbsp;But, she did not score grade C in any subject. The only option possible is A + B + A + B in the order of P.T., Mathematics, Science, and Drawing. <br \/><br \/>Gopi's total grade point is 20. His total GP in P.T., Mathematics, and Science is 18. The only option possible is C + A + B in the order of P.T., Mathematics, and Science. <br \/><br \/>We can easily identify that Ekansh received grade F in Drawing and grade D in Spelling. <br \/><br \/>Dahana cannot receive grade F both in P.T. and Drawing, but received 4 GPs combining P.T., Drawing and Spelling. Thus, she received grade D in both P.T. and Drawing, and failed in Spelling. <br \/><br \/>Now, we can say that Chahel received grades A and B in Drawing and Spelling in some order. <br \/><br \/>Bobita&rsquo;s total grade point is 16. Her total GP in Mathematics and Drawing is 4. Bobita can get a C grade neither in Mathematics (because of Chahel) nor in Drawing (because of Abhinav). The only option possible is D + D in Mathematics and Drawing.&nbsp;Thus Indrajeet and Bobita are the two students who have passed in all the subjects. <br \/><br \/>As Abhinav cannot receive grade C in any of the three subjects viz. P.T., Science, and Spelling, therefore, he must have received grade B in Science, and failed in both P.T. and Spelling. <br \/><br \/>The final result is shown below. <br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 81px;

Exactly two students have passed in all the subjects. <br \/>5. No student failed (i.e. received &lsquo;F&rsquo; grade) in Science.<\/p>","PassageTitle":"q1-5","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>We calculate the&nbsp;sum total of grade points received by each student by multiplying his\/her GPA with 5. <br \/><br \/>Jagat's total grade point is 16. Sum of his GPs in P.T., Science and Spelling must be 4. According to point 3 he must have received grade D in both P.T. and Drawing.&nbsp;Thus he failed in Spelling. <br \/><br \/>Indrajeet's total grade point is 28. According to point 2, we cannot take A + A + A + D (in some order). We will not be able to fit A + B + B + B as no two vertically consecutive cells contain the same grade. The only option left is B\/C + A + A + C\/B in the order of P.T., Mathematics, Science, and Drawing. Thus, Indrajeet is one such student who passed in all the subjects. <br \/><br \/>Harini's total grade point is 10. She failed in two subjects and received grade D in one subject. Thus, she must have received grade D in Drawing and failed in P.T. and Spelling.&nbsp; <br \/><br \/>Faiza's total grade point is 28.&nbsp;But, she did not score grade C in any subject. The only option possible is A + B + A + B in the order of P.T., Mathematics, Science, and Drawing. <br \/><br \/>Gopi's total grade point is 20. His total GP in P.T., Mathematics, and Science is 18. The only option possible is C + A + B in the order of P.T., Mathematics, and Science. <br \/><br \/>We can easily identify that Ekansh received grade F in Drawing and grade D in Spelling. <br \/><br \/>Dahana cannot receive grade F both in P.T. and Drawing, but received 4 GPs combining P.T., Drawing and Spelling. Thus, she received grade D in both P.T. and Drawing, and failed in Spelling. <br \/><br \/>Now, we can say that Chahel received grades A and B in Drawing and Spelling in some order. <br \/><br \/>Bobita&rsquo;s total grade point is 16. Her total GP in Mathematics and Drawing is 4. Bobita can get a C grade neither in Mathematics (because of Chahel) nor in Drawing (because of Abhinav). The only option possible is D + D in Mathematics and Drawing.&nbsp;Thus Indrajeet and Bobita are the two students who have passed in all the subjects. <br \/><br \/>As Abhinav cannot receive grade C in any of the three subjects viz. P.T., Science, and Spelling, therefore, he must have received grade B in Science, and failed in both P.T. and Spelling. <br \/><br \/>The final result is shown below. <br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 81px;

According to point 3 he must have received grade D in both P.T. and Drawing.&nbsp;Thus he failed in Spelling. <br \/><br \/>Indrajeet's total grade point is 28. According to point 2, we cannot take A + A + A + D (in some order). We will not be able to fit A + B + B + B as no two vertically consecutive cells contain the same grade. The only option left is B\/C + A + A + C\/B in the order of P.T., Mathematics, Science, and Drawing. Thus, Indrajeet is one such student who passed in all the subjects. <br \/><br \/>Harini's total grade point is 10. She failed in two subjects and received grade D in one subject. Thus, she must have received grade D in Drawing and failed in P.T. and Spelling.&nbsp; <br \/><br \/>Faiza's total grade point is 28.&nbsp;But, she did not score grade C in any subject. The only option possible is A + B + A + B in the order of P.T., Mathematics, Science, and Drawing. <br \/><br \/>Gopi's total grade point is 20. His total GP in P.T., Mathematics, and Science is 18. The only option possible is C + A + B in the order of P.T., Mathematics, and Science. <br \/><br \/>We can easily identify that Ekansh received grade F in Drawing and grade D in Spelling. <br \/><br \/>Dahana cannot receive grade F both in P.T. and Drawing, but received 4 GPs combining P.T., Drawing and Spelling. Thus, she received grade D in both P.T. and Drawing, and failed in Spelling. <br \/><br \/>Now, we can say that Chahel received grades A and B in Drawing and Spelling in some order. <br \/><br \/>Bobita&rsquo;s total grade point is 16. Her total GP in Mathematics and Drawing is 4. Bobita can get a C grade neither in Mathematics (because of Chahel) nor in Drawing (because of Abhinav). The only option possible is D + D in Mathematics and Drawing.&nbsp;Thus Indrajeet and Bobita are the two students who have passed in all the subjects. <br \/><br \/>As Abhinav cannot receive grade C in any of the three subjects viz. P.T., Science, and Spelling, therefore, he must have received grade B in Science, and failed in both P.T. and Spelling. <br \/><br \/>The final result is shown below. <br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 81px;

Ten students have been enrolled in one such coaching batch and Shiva has conducted a class test on five different subjects for these students. The results of the students in this class test have been tabulated by Shiva using a grading system. In the grading system, A, B, C, D, and F grades fetch 8, 6, 4, 2, and 0 grade points respectively. The Grade Point Average (GPA) is the arithmetic mean of the grade points obtained in the five subjects. For example, if a student has received A, A, B, D, and C grades in five different subjects, his or her GPA is \\({(8&nbsp; +&nbsp; 8&nbsp; +&nbsp; 6&nbsp; +&nbsp; 2&nbsp; +&nbsp; 4) \\over {5}}\\) = 5.6. Only &lsquo;F&rsquo; grade is considered a failing grade. The tabular representation of these ten students&rsquo; grades and their GPAs are shown below (the names of the students in the table have been written in alphabetical order from top to bottom): <br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 83px;

According to point 3 he must have received grade D in both P.T. and Drawing.&nbsp;Thus he failed in Spelling. <br \/><br \/>Indrajeet's total grade point is 28. According to point 2, we cannot take A + A + A + D (in some order). We will not be able to fit A + B + B + B as no two vertically consecutive cells contain the same grade. The only option left is B\/C + A + A + C\/B in the order of P.T., Mathematics, Science, and Drawing. Thus, Indrajeet is one such student who passed in all the subjects. <br \/><br \/>Harini's total grade point is 10. She failed in two subjects and received grade D in one subject. Thus, she must have received grade D in Drawing and failed in P.T. and Spelling.&nbsp; <br \/><br \/>Faiza's total grade point is 28.&nbsp;But, she did not score grade C in any subject. The only option possible is A + B + A + B in the order of P.T., Mathematics, Science, and Drawing. <br \/><br \/>Gopi's total grade point is 20. His total GP in P.T., Mathematics, and Science is 18. The only option possible is C + A + B in the order of P.T., Mathematics, and Science. <br \/><br \/>We can easily identify that Ekansh received grade F in Drawing and grade D in Spelling. <br \/><br \/>Dahana cannot receive grade F both in P.T. and Drawing, but received 4 GPs combining P.T., Drawing and Spelling. Thus, she received grade D in both P.T. and Drawing, and failed in Spelling. <br \/><br \/>Now, we can say that Chahel received grades A and B in Drawing and Spelling in some order. <br \/><br \/>Bobita&rsquo;s total grade point is 16. Her total GP in Mathematics and Drawing is 4. Bobita can get a C grade neither in Mathematics (because of Chahel) nor in Drawing (because of Abhinav). The only option possible is D + D in Mathematics and Drawing.&nbsp;Thus Indrajeet and Bobita are the two students who have passed in all the subjects. <br \/><br \/>As Abhinav cannot receive grade C in any of the three subjects viz. P.T., Science, and Spelling, therefore, he must have received grade B in Science, and failed in both P.T. and Spelling. <br \/><br \/>The final result is shown below. <br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 81px;

Ltd. manufactures automobile spare parts. It has five different plants in five cities across India. Each plant has exactly six units. Employees working in any unit require specialised skills and that is why they cannot move from one unit to another. The rules set by the company state that each unit in each plant should have exactly 50 employees out of which at least 20% employees should be female. The management of the company has decided to start a new manufacturing plant and for that they need skilled workers. The management has decided that in order to ensure initiation of smooth operation in the new plant, employees in each unit of the new plant will be populated by transferring existing employees from old five plants uniformly. The shortfall in the existing plants generated because of these transfers will be filled with new employees. The HR manager has asked his assistant Sachin to prepare a list of employees who will be transferred. <br \/><br \/>Sachin has selected the following methodology for the same:<br \/>Suppose he has to select x% employees of a unit of a specific plant for transfer where the existing number of male employees is M and that of female is F. The number of male employees to be transferred is <span style=\"font-family: Cambria Math;\">&lceil;<\/span>x% of M<span style=\"font-family: Cambria Math;\">&rceil;<\/span> and number of female employees to be transferred is {x% of (M + F) &ndash; <span style=\"font-family: Cambria Math;\">&lceil;<\/span>x% of M<span style=\"font-family: Cambria Math;\">&rceil;<\/span>}. Here, <span style=\"font-family: Cambria Math;\">&lceil;<\/span>x% of M<span style=\"font-family: Cambria Math;\">&rceil;<\/span> represents the smallest integer greater than or equal to (x% of M).<br \/><br \/>The following table shows the number of female employees to be transferred from various plants to the new plant.

        <ol>
            <li>Use only the latest version of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge</li>
            <li>The browser window width should be 1200 pixels or higher. Your current browser window width is <span id="currentWindowWidth"></span> pixels.<br>
                Maximize the browser screen and check again if it's not already maximized.
                If you are still seeing this message, we recommend you to increase your screen resolution.
                In case your PC does not support the required resolution, decrease the zoom level of the browser by
                pressing Control and - (minus) buttons on your keyboard till you see the content properly.</li>
