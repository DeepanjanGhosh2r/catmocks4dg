According to proponents of this idea, management is pass\u00e9.

First, it doesn\u2019t offer systematic evidence for <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">delayering<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> and radical decentralisation across firms in general, but rather a few cherry-picked examples. In many cases, these firms already had in place a technology that makes decentralisation easy. One of these examples, <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Valve<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> relies on heavily modularised software development that can easily be delegated to self-managing teams, and others like Apple (under its late CEO Jobs) and Tesla are run by heavy-handed, even overpowering, top managers. Charismatic figures such as <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Elon<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> Musk fill the headlines in the business press, though they are often better known for their visionary leadership than their managerial effectiveness. Musk urges his employees at Tesla to interact freely, without regard to divisional boundaries or any sort of chain of command. Communicating through layers of management, he wrote in a company memo a few years ago, \u2018is incredibly dumb\u2019. The media fawned and yet, as Tesla continues to struggle to meet its production targets for the Model 3 electric car, the company\u2019s extreme reduction in hierarchy levels and Musk\u2019s continual micromanagement, unwillingness to delegate and insistence on doing things differently, are taking some heat. <\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Also, companies that have survived major shocks to their markets or technology have often benefited from having strong leaders with almost authoritarian leadership styles; think of Disney, Xerox and IBM. There is a lesson to be learned: centralising the authority to make decisions is usually a more effective way to adapt to unanticipated change than more collaborative, consensus-driven approaches. This is particularly the case for firms with heavily interdependent resources and activities. <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A lateral<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">,<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> consensus-driven approach will likely lead to those delays that can harm the survival of the firm.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Second, academic research on <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">delayering<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> paints a more complex picture than the cartoon version in the <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">bossless<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">-company literature. One important study observed 300 \u2018Fortune 500\u2019 companies for 14 years and found that firms were getting flatter, but were doing so to concentrate authority in the hands of senior managers, not to empower workers. <\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Third, while technological miracles such as the internet have induced sweeping changes in all sectors, the laws of economics are still the laws of economics. And human nature hasn\u2019t changed. The basic problem of management and business is still the same. Since the industrial revolution, entrepreneurs have been regularly organising extremely complex activities in firms that are neither completely centralised nor completely flat.

He uses it to describe the process of taking on information about our bodies and environment in a form that enables us to act intelligently without much attention, effort or thought. Just as a river accumulates particles and deposits them as <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">sedimented<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> structures that direct the river\u2019s flow, argued <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Merleau<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">-<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Ponty<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">, so we accumulate information as we go about our lives, which gradually and unconsciously builds into contoured bedrock of understanding that guides our behaviour.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Merleau-Ponty\u2019s<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> work helps us to see how our behaviour can be influenced by stereotypes that we do not agree with. As this sedimentation process is insensitive to whether we are interacting with the world itself or with media representations of it, stereotypes occurring regularly in our media will become integrated into our worldview along with knowledge of the real world. Because he focused on knowledge, <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Merleau<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">-<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Ponty<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> did not develop a theory of the sedimentation of goals and motivations.  For a unified account of how our behaviour can be effortlessly influenced by our own repeatedly endorsed motivations and by social stereotypes that we do not endorse, we can turn to the existentialist writings of Simone de Beauvoir and Frantz Fanon. De Beauvoir focuses on how we develop our goals and values. Girls and boys are raised with different expectations and inducements, and so are continually encouraged to think and act in ways that fit their assigned gender. Girls are required to respond to their environments in pleasing and helpful ways, whereas boys are encouraged to explore and dominate theirs.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">These expectations shape the goals and values that we pursue across childhood and adolescence. De Beauvoir argued that this repeated endorsement of the same goals and values embeds them into our cognitive systems through sedimentation. Because girls and boys are subject to different expectations, we develop gendered sets of goals and values. Our goals and values become <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">sedimented<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> through repetition, and so do our strategies for achieving them. <\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Fanon presented a similar account of the origins of racial identity. He described the stories and films common to childhoods across France and the French colonies in the first half of the 20th century, including anecdotes from his own upbringing in Martinique. These tended to show Europeans as heroic and sophisticated. By contrast, when Africans were presented at all, they were shown as inferior and dangerous. Fanon argued that the combination of this with the imagery in stories and films inculcated <\/span>an idea of European superiority and African inferiority in everyone brought up this way. The version of sedimentation that de Beauvoir and Fanon argued for is specifically existentialist.<br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">By considering other people\u2019s ideas or taking up a critical perspective on our own ideas, we can formulate conclusions at odds with our <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">sedimented<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> outlook. This explains why subtle aspects of our behaviour can manifest <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">sedimented<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> stereotypes that we do not endorse. But it also indicates how we can take control of the intuitions and feelings that drive these aspects of our behaviour.<\/span>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> 1<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><sup>st<\/sup><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> paragraph briefly explains<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Merleau-Ponty\u2019s<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> concept of \u2018sedimentation\u2019.

After a month of following this daily pattern, rats display behaviours similar to those on drugs of abuse. They\u2019ll binge on the sugar solution in a short period of time, much more than their regular food. They also show signs of anxiety and depression during the food deprivation period.

All of these components have been observed in animal models of addiction \u2013 for sugar, as well as drugs of abuse.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A typical experiment goes like this: rats are deprived of food for 12 hours each day, <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">then<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> given 12 hours of access to a sugary solution and regular chow. After a month of following this daily pattern, rats display behaviours similar to those on drugs of abuse. They\u2019ll binge on the sugar solution in a short period of time, much more than their regular food. They also show signs of anxiety and depression during the food deprivation period. Many sugar-treated rats who are later exposed to drugs, such as\u00a0cocaine, demonstrate dependent behaviours towards the drugs compared to rats who did not consume sugar beforehand.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Like drugs, sugar spikes dopamine release in the brain. Over the long term, regular sugar consumption actually changes the gene expression and availability of dopamine receptors in the brain. Specifically, sugar increases the concentration of a type of excitatory receptor called D1, but decreases another receptor type called D2, which is inhibitory. <\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In short, this means that repeated access to sugar over time leads to prolonged dopamine signalling, greater excitation of the brain and a need for even more sugar to activate all of the dopamine receptors like before. The brain becomes tolerant to sugar \u2013 and more is needed to attain the same \u201csugar high.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In a related study, rats that had undergone a typical sugar dependence protocol then underwent \u201csugar withdrawal.\u201d This was facilitated by either food deprivation or treatment with <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">naloxone<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">, a drug used for treating opiate addiction which binds to receptors in the brain. Both withdrawal methods led to physical problems, including teeth chattering, paw tremors, and head shaking. <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Naloxone<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> treatment also appeared to make the rats more anxious, as they spent less time on an elevated apparatus that lacked walls on either side.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Another study reports that sugar withdrawal is also linked to impulsive behaviour. Initially, rats were trained to receive water by pushing a lever. After training, the animals returned to their home cages and <\/span>had access to a sugar solution and water, or just water alone. After 30 days, when rats were again given the opportunity to press a lever for water, those who had become dependent on sugar pressed the lever significantly more times than others. <br \/><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">These are extreme experiments, of course.

Choose the best answer for each question.<\/strong><\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> What is it like to be a cow? Researchers such as Jeremy <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Bailenson<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">, the director of the Virtual Human Interaction Lab in California, and his colleagues at Stanford University created a simulation of a slaughterhouse. In a series of experiments, <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Bailenson<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> invited people to don virtual reality (VR) headsets, and walk around on all fours to experience \u2018what it\u2019s like to be a cow that\u2019s <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">raised<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> for dairy and for meat\u2019. You go down to a <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">trough,<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> you put your head down and pretend to drink some water. You amble over to a pile of hay, you put your head down and you pretend to eat hay. For a time after their VR experience, people found themselves eating less meat. One subject remarked: \u2018I truly felt like I was going to the slaughterhouse \u2026 and felt sad that as a cow I was going to die.\u2019<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">But we should be <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">skeptical<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> of these claims. While VR might help us to cultivate sympathy, it fails to generate true empathy. Empathy is what we use when we engage in perspective-taking. Sympathy, meanwhile, involves the capacities that help us feel for another. <\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Empathy is very, very hard \u2013 and sometimes, it\u2019s simply impossible. In his classic 1974 essay, the American philosopher Thomas Nagel argued that humans could not imagine what it was like to be a bat, even if we went to great lengths to try and live like one. A gap of understanding arises because our evolved way of being embodied and our very human, very self-reflective, and very personal life experiences shape the way the world seems to us. <\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">VR is a powerful tool, but it cannot alter basic biological embodiment or psychology. Human experiences are sufficiently unlike cow or bat experiences that it\u2019s impossible for us to know what those experiences are like. But can\u2019t VR at least help us take on the perspective of other people \u2013 such as those experiencing homelessness or racial discrimination? After all, two humans are much more alike than humans and cows. <\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Conscious experiences acquire their meanings in part via panoply of <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">nonconscious<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> processes. These include not only your biology, but also your cultural concepts, past experiences, emotions, expectations and even features of the specific situations in which you find yourself. As the philosopher Alva <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">No\u00eb<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> explains: perception is something we actively do, not something we passively experience. Our expectations, along with other background processes, help to determine how we understand the things that we see, hear, feel and think, and these processes vary from person to person. They are powerful enough to affect even seemingly <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">nonconscious<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> empathic processes.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Imagine if I came to the conclusion that homelessness wasn\u2019t that big a deal because I enjoyed the challenging puzzle elements in the VR experience \u2018Becoming Homeless.\u2019 Imagine if I believed I now had better insight into homelessness, and that it wasn\u2019t as bad as I feared. I might change the way I thought about homelessness, and the sorts of policies I voted for. Such failures of sympathy, grounded in false beliefs about our VR\u2019s ability to produce empathy, can be avoided. VR is an important tool, and research shows that it can radically affect the way we think about the world. But we shouldn\u2019t be so quick to assume that it endows us with true, first-person, empathetic understanding. That would be bovine indeed.<\/span><\/p>","PassageTitle":"passage","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> main argument<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">is\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">explicitly stated in this passage.

So, sentence 2 is the best starter. Both sentences 3 and 4 can be considered to follow sentence 2. However, \u2018though\u2019 in sentence 3 does not logically connect it well with sentence 2.
