Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Evolution has favoured the honing of vision in primates more than in other mammals. Primates have greater depth perception from having forward-facing eyes with extensively overlapping visual fields, sharper visual acuity, more brain areas involved with vision, and, in some primates, trichromatic vision (i.e. they can distinguish red from green). In fact, primates rely much more on vision than on the other senses \u2013 unlike other mammals who depend equally on multiple senses.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The \u2018snake detection theory\u2019 posits that when large-gaped constricting snakes appeared about 100 million years ago and began eating mammals, this predation favoured modification of vision in one kind of prey, the lineage of monkeys destined to lose the tail: the ability to see predatory snakes before getting too close became a highly beneficial trait for them to have and pass on to their offspring. Then, about 60 million years ago, venomous snakes appeared in Africa or Asia, sharpening the natural selection of primates who could detect and avoid snakes. <\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The degree of complexity in primate visual systems and the length of evolutionary time that primates have spent with venomous snakes match perfectly. The lineage that comprises African and Asian monkeys, apes and humans has the best vision of all mammals (i.e. fully trichromatic vision). These evolved roughly at the same time and in the same place as venomous snakes. They are also uniformly wary of snakes. On the other hand, Madagascar primates have the simplest visual systems. They have low visual acuity because their fovea, a depression in the retina that is responsible for our visual acuity wherever we focus our eyes, is poorly developed (when it\u2019s present at all). Although Madagascar has constricting snakes, it has no venomous snakes, so primates on that island never had to face that particular selective pressure. In fact, they don\u2019t all react fearfully toward snakes: some even walk on snakes or snake models, treating them as just another branch.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The visual systems of North or South American monkeys are in the middle. They have better visual acuity than Madagascar primates but more variability in their visual systems than African or Asian monkeys. For example, American howler monkeys are all fully trichromatic, but in other American primate species, only some individuals are able to distinguish red from green hues. American primates were originally part of the anthropoid primate lineage in Africa that also includes African and Asian monkeys and apes, and so had to deal with venomous snakes for about 20-25 million years, but then, some 36 million years ago, they left Africa and arrived in South America where \u2013 though constrictors were there \u2013 venomous snakes were absent until roughly 15 million years later. By then, American monkeys had begun to diversify into different genera, and so each genus evolved separate solutions to the renewed problem caused by the arrival of venomous snakes. <\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Several studies have shown that nonhuman and human primates, including young children and snake-naive infants, have a visual bias toward snakes compared with other animate objects, such as lizards, spiders, worms, birds and flowers; that we pick out images of snakes faster or more accurately than those of other objects, especially under cluttered and obscuring conditions or when we have to decide fast; that <\/span>snakes also distract us from finding other objects as quickly; and our \u2018primary visual area\u2019 in the brain shows electrophysiological responses to images of snakes for 150-300 milliseconds longer than it does for those of lizards.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">According to the passage, predation by large constricting snakes in particular forced primates to develop a better vision around 100 million years ago and, 40 million years down the line, the appearance of venomous snakes accentuated that pressure. In other words, &ldquo;the ability to see predatory snakes before getting too close became a highly beneficial trait for them to have and pass on to their offspring&rdquo;. That the same pressure had not already been or were not exerted by other predators can be explained only by the differences between the snakes and the other contemporary predators.<\/span> <br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Option 1: Incorrect.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Evolution has favoured the honing of vision in primates more than in other mammals. Primates have greater depth perception from having forward-facing eyes with extensively overlapping visual fields, sharper visual acuity, more brain areas involved with vision, and, in some primates, trichromatic vision (i.e. they can distinguish red from green). In fact, primates rely much more on vision than on the other senses \u2013 unlike other mammals who depend equally on multiple senses.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The \u2018snake detection theory\u2019 posits that when large-gaped constricting snakes appeared about 100 million years ago and began eating mammals, this predation favoured modification of vision in one kind of prey, the lineage of monkeys destined to lose the tail: the ability to see predatory snakes before getting too close became a highly beneficial trait for them to have and pass on to their offspring. Then, about 60 million years ago, venomous snakes appeared in Africa or Asia, sharpening the natural selection of primates who could detect and avoid snakes. <\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The degree of complexity in primate visual systems and the length of evolutionary time that primates have spent with venomous snakes match perfectly. The lineage that comprises African and Asian monkeys, apes and humans has the best vision of all mammals (i.e. fully trichromatic vision). These evolved roughly at the same time and in the same place as venomous snakes. They are also uniformly wary of snakes. On the other hand, Madagascar primates have the simplest visual systems. They have low visual acuity because their fovea, a depression in the retina that is responsible for our visual acuity wherever we focus our eyes, is poorly developed (when it\u2019s present at all). Although Madagascar has constricting snakes, it has no venomous snakes, so primates on that island never had to face that particular selective pressure. In fact, they don\u2019t all react fearfully toward snakes: some even walk on snakes or snake models, treating them as just another branch.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The visual systems of North or South American monkeys are in the middle. They have better visual acuity than Madagascar primates but more variability in their visual systems than African or Asian monkeys. For example, American howler monkeys are all fully trichromatic, but in other American primate species, only some individuals are able to distinguish red from green hues. American primates were originally part of the anthropoid primate lineage in Africa that also includes African and Asian monkeys and apes, and so had to deal with venomous snakes for about 20-25 million years, but then, some 36 million years ago, they left Africa and arrived in South America where \u2013 though constrictors were there \u2013 venomous snakes were absent until roughly 15 million years later.

Anyhow, that\u2019s my intention now. <br><br>The period that mostly concerns us is the two and a half millennia from 4000 to 1500 BC. It\u2019s a long time, but a great deal happened. The last Ice Age gradually ended around 10,000 BC. There was then a sudden warming of about ten degrees Celsius at 9600 BC. By 8000 BC the climate may even have been slightly warmer than it is today. The warmer temperatures caused North Sea levels to rise quite rapidly and people were forced to move away from the game and fish-rich low-lying pastures of Doggerland (the name given to the once undulating plain beneath the southern North Sea basin) and move to what had been the distant and less hospitable hinterland of Britain, and north-western Europe. This meant that the population rose quite rapidly at the time when Britain was becoming an island \u2013 a process that was complete by about 6000 BC. The population subsisted by hunting, fishing and foraging. They had domesticated dogs (from wolves), and while some adapted a semi-migratory lifestyle, following traditional routes, others settled down permanently, often around lakes and streams. The earliest known family houses in Britain are from Star Carr in Yorkshire and date to about 9000 BC. Two millennia after Britain finally separated from the continental mainland, the first farmers arrived. By now, the British population was about 200-300,000 (the same as modern Belfast or Newcastle).<br><br>Farming was introduced by an influx of about 25% new people, many of whom arrived on the south coast. But this was not a Cowboys and Indians confrontation. It would seem the indigenous hunter-forager population was eager to accept the new way of life. The arrival of farming brought with it not just permanent settlement, but fixed burial sites and new forms of ceremonial monuments. There was an unstated implication that the post-Ice Age hunters had bigger things to worry about than creating new religions. All of that came with the greater leisure afforded by food-production. We now realise that this was all rubbish. Far from having less time to ponder the eternal verities of life, hunters of the recent past had ample leisure in which to create extraordinarily rich spiritual realms, that they passed down to their children \u2013 a process, surely, of education.<br><br>Recent research in the landscape surrounding Stonehenge shows that there were at least three places that were venerated from early Mesolithic times, around 8000 BC. We also now know that the area continued to be populated for another 4,000 years until the introduction of farming. In other words, the diverse spiritual origins of what was to become the Stonehenge ritual landscape have roots that were very ancient indeed. The term ritual landscape is used to describe concentrations of funerary and ceremonial monuments that were constructed in the Neolithic (4000- 2500 BC) and Early Bronze Age (2500-1500 BC).","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>The passage introduces the term &lsquo;ritual landscape&rsquo; in the first paragraph and goes on to explain what it&nbsp;actually stands for.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Philosophy seems to be on a hiding to nothing. It has a 2,500-year history in the West and an extensive back-catalogue \u2013 of problems. There are questions about what exists, and what we know about it, such as: Do we have free will? Is there an external world? Does God exist? and so on. There are also questions of analysis and definition such as: What makes a sentence true? What makes an act just? What is causation? What is a person? This is a tiny sample. For almost any abstract notion, some philosopher has wondered what it really is.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Yet, despite this wealth of questions and the centuries spent tackling them, philosophers haven\u2019t successfully provided any answers. They\u2019ve tried long and hard but nothing they\u2019ve said towards answering those questions has quite made the grade. Other philosophers haven\u2019t been slow to pick holes in their attempted answers and expose flaws or dubious assumptions in them. The punctures in the attempted answers then get patched up and put up for discussion again. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">But,<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> what happens is that new punctures appear, or the patches fail and the old punctures are revealed again. Philosophy emerges as a series of arguments without end, and its questions settle into seemingly intractable problems.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Here is a little gem from the 18th century. It\u2019s known as Molyneux\u2019s problem. Molyneux, the Irish scientist and politician, posed a question that has stumped philosophers ever since.  Imagine someone completely blind from birth who\u2019s been able to explore both a cube and a globe by touch. This person learns to identify and name these shapes. Now, suppose that this person is later able to see. Would they then be able to identify which is the cube and which is the globe, just by sight? Imagine them standing at a distance from the shapes. Would they be able to tell simply from looking which was the globe and which was the cube?<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Here is a companion thought experiment, now called the knowledge argument. By reading the appropriate books, you could learn all about the chemistry of ammonia. By reading more books, you could learn all about how the human olfactory system works and<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">, in particular, how<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> it reacts in response to ammonia molecules \u2013 what distinctive changes occur in the mucous membrane and in the olfactory nerves. Given all this textbook information, though, could you then know all there is to know about the smell of ammonia? Or is there something about the smell of ammonia, the qualitative experience of that sharp, pungent aroma, that you won\u2019t understand from this learning, independent of experience?<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Is the thought experiment illuminating about human nature, or has it gone badly wrong? The jury remains out on this, and indeed on every other, problem in philosophy. Philosophy displays increasing ingenuity without an emerging consensus. Progress doesn\u2019t require consensus, of course: some philosophers might have solved a given problem without this being acknowledged <\/span>across the board. But the degree to which there is, or isn\u2019t, consensus in a given field can be one indicator of how much progress has been achieved.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\">This is a vocabulary question.
