Choose the best answer to each question.<\/strong> <br \/><br \/>Mountains have long posed intellectual difficulties for those who have pondered their meaning and origins. Following a trip to the Alps in 1671, the English theologian and natural philosopher Thomas Burnet described the montane landscape with revulsion, remarking that its &lsquo;vast undigested heaps of stone&rsquo; defy any &lsquo;tolerable account of how that confusion came in nature&rsquo;. Seeking to understand why such atrocities would even be part of Creation, he noted with scholarly astuteness that mountains are absent from the first chapter of Genesis, and thus not original features on Earth, though they had apparently come into being in time for Noah and crew to wash up on the slopes of Mount Ararat. In his treatise Telluris Theoria Sacra (1681), Burnet suggested that the primordial Earth had been a smooth &lsquo;mundane egg&rsquo; that cracked and released the deluge that Noah had to survive. Mountains were the resulting scars on the face of the Earth, their stern presence a reminder of, and punishment for, Man&rsquo;s iniquity. <br \/><br \/>Burnet&rsquo;s ideas are easy to ridicule, and were treated with particular scorn by Charles Lyell, one of the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century&rsquo;s founding figures in geology. But as Stephen Jay Gould argued in Time&rsquo;s Arrow, Time&rsquo;s Cycle (1987), Burnet&rsquo;s approach was rational, in that he was attempting to integrate sacred and secular knowledge into an internally consistent narrative. In fact, Burnet was correct on two counts: mountains are not primordial features; and mountain-building does involve disrupting the Earth&rsquo;s outer &lsquo;shell&rsquo; or crust. My own field, known as &lsquo;structural geology&rsquo;, concerns itself with the deformation of the planet&rsquo;s crust, though of course we have long since abandoned notions of a primeval egg. We map active fault zones that generate earthquakes and ancient ones that host ore minerals or act as traps for petroleum. We help with the safe siting of large infrastructure projects such as tunnels, bridges and dams. And we document the growth of mountains. <br \/><br \/>Geologists did not have a clear understanding of how mountains came to be there even when the first test rockets for the Apollo programme were being launched. Geodynamics had been stuck with speculative theories formulated in the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century when &ndash; in 1963 &ndash; the scientific paper that sparked the modern plate-tectonics revolution &ndash; an understated three-page article in Nature positing the phenomenon of sea-floor spreading &ndash; was published. <br \/><br \/>But it is fascinating to listen in on the conversations among geologists who studied mountains in the century before plate tectonics. Many field-based geologists did excellent observational science that remains useful today, even though they laboured under a limiting interpretive paradigm. In contrast, some of the most prominent geologists of the time, less concerned with the messy ground truth of rocks than with staking a claim to a grand unifying theory, contributed to an elaborate fiction about the genesis of mountains that is almost as risible as Burnet&rsquo;s erupting egg. Their ardent adherence to such theory exposes a basic tension in the study of the Earth: whether it can be understood like the cosmos, subject to timeless laws, or more like a language, evolving and idiosyncratic.<\/p>","PassageTitle":".","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">\u201cGeologists did not have a clear understanding of how mountains came to be there even when the first test rockets for the Apollo programme were being launched.

This bacterium caused the Black Death, a plague pandemic that moved from Asia to Europe in just a few decades, wiping out one-third to one-half of all human life wherever it touched. Although the plague pandemic <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">definitely happened<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">, the story I\u2019ve been teaching about when, where, and the history of the bacterium has apparently been incomplete, at best.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">In December, the historian Monica Green published a landmark article,<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The Four Black Deaths<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">, in the<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">American Historical Review<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">, that rewrites our narrative of this brutal and transformative pandemic. In it, she identifies a \u201cbig bang\u201d that created four distinct genetic lineages that spread separately throughout the world and finds concrete evidence that the plague was already spreading from China to central Asia <\/span>in the 1200s. This discovery pushes the origins of the Black Death back by over a hundred years, meaning that the first wave of the plague was not a decades-long explosion of horror, but a disease that crept across the continents for over a hundred years until it reached a crisis point. <br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">As the world reels beneath the strains of its own global pandemic, the importance of understanding how humans interact with nature both today and throughout the relatively short history of our species becomes more critical. Green tells me that diseases like the plague and SARS-CoV-2 (before it transferred into humans in late 2019 causing Covid-19) are not human diseases, because the organisms do not rely on human hosts for reproduction (unlike human-adapted malaria or tuberculosis). They are zoonotic, or animal diseases, but humans are still the carriers and transporters of the bacteria from one site to the other, turning an endemic animal disease into a deadly human one.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The Black Death, as Monica Green tells me, is \u201cone of the few things that people learn about the European Middle Ages.\u201d For scholars, the 14th-century story contained what Green calls a \u201cblack hole.\u201d When she began her career in the 1980s, we didn\u2019t really know \u201cwhen it happened, how it happened, [or] where it came from!\u201d Now we have a much clearer picture.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">\u201cThe Black Death and other pre-modern plague outbreaks were something everyone learned about in <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">school, <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">o<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">r<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> joked about in a Monty Python-esque way.

Although the plague pandemic <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">definitely happened<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">, the story I\u2019ve been teaching about when, where, and the history of the bacterium has apparently been incomplete, at best.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">In December, the historian Monica Green published a landmark article,<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The Four Black Deaths<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">, in the<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">American Historical Review<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">, that rewrites our narrative of this brutal and transformative pandemic. In it, she identifies a \u201cbig bang\u201d that created four distinct genetic lineages that spread separately throughout the world and finds concrete evidence that the plague was already spreading from China to central Asia <\/span>in the 1200s. This discovery pushes the origins of the Black Death back by over a hundred years, meaning that the first wave of the plague was not a decades-long explosion of horror, but a disease that crept across the continents for over a hundred years until it reached a crisis point. <br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">As the world reels beneath the strains of its own global pandemic, the importance of understanding how humans interact with nature both today and throughout the relatively short history of our species becomes more critical. Green tells me that diseases like the plague and SARS-CoV-2 (before it transferred into humans in late 2019 causing Covid-19) are not human diseases, because the organisms do not rely on human hosts for reproduction (unlike human-adapted malaria or tuberculosis). They are zoonotic, or animal diseases, but humans are still the carriers and transporters of the bacteria from one site to the other, turning an endemic animal disease into a deadly human one.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The Black Death, as Monica Green tells me, is \u201cone of the few things that people learn about the European Middle Ages.\u201d For scholars, the 14th-century story contained what Green calls a \u201cblack hole.\u201d When she began her career in the 1980s, we didn\u2019t really know \u201cwhen it happened, how it happened, [or] where it came from!\u201d Now we have a much clearer picture.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">\u201cThe Black Death and other pre-modern plague outbreaks were something everyone learned about in <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">school, <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">o<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">r<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> joked about in a Monty Python-esque way.

Now, \u201cwith the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, suddenly medieval plagues became relevant to everyone everywhere.\u201d <\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The project that culminated in <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Green\u2019s<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> article unfolded over many years. She says that the first step required paleogenetic analysis of known victims of the plague,\u00a0including a critical study in 2011.\u00a0Paleogenetics is the study of preserved organic material\u2014really any part of the body or the microbiome, down to the DNA\u2014of long dead organisms. This means that if you can find a body, or preferably a lot of bodies, that you\u2019re sure died in the Black Death, you can often access the DNA of the specific disease that killed them and compare it to both modern and other pre-modern strains.<\/span>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Option 1: Option 1 cannot be inferred from the passage.

He did not become a public figure because his thought is difficult, yet he did become a public figure of uneasy thought. Epithets such as \u201cuncompromising,\u201d \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">concessionless<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">,\u201d and \u201cunforgiving\u201d suit his work better. He wrote for a public about a public to challenge the authority of public opinion. He wrote to reject the generation of a cult following.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">When Adorno returned to West Germany in 1949, he lectured in the public media, <\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">universities<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> and research institutes on the difficulties of bringing democracy to a society that he worried was neither deserving of it nor mature enough to rid itself entirely of its all too recent comfortable order of terror. He asked what it meant to bring democracy to a country that had formerly been governed by dictatorship. He looked to the United States, where he had lived for ten years in exile, less for an answer than for a model, indeed a critical model, of the most advanced society. He was obliged by fast-changing world circumstances to think deeply about the end of one war\u2014a total one\u2014and the start of another\u2014a cold one\u2014and, therefore, about the change of alliances that moved at least one half of a divided Germany from deep political enmity to reserved friendship with the United States. He argued that bringing democracy to a country meant less the objective destruction of the remaining edifices of dictatorship\u2014the monuments, buildings, and street-names\u2014than the subjective education of its people. The culture, he remarked, will still be in ruins even after the rubble has been cleared. He asked for \u201ca turn to the subject\u201d through a confrontation with the past by subjects lost to the idola theatri of dictatorship.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Adorno did not think that every turn toward democracy is necessarily, or could be immediately, an advance in the concept of democracy. Democracy can go wrong. He worried that too fast a democratizing process would more suppress than transform the kind of public opinion that had enabled the dictatorship in the first place (especially when that dictatorship had emerged, as it had in Germany, out of a mass or popular movement). He was surprised by how deeply antidemocratic sentiments remained ingrained in the social consciousness of the German people. He argued that intolerance, complicity, and relations of domination exist not in private opinions as such; they exist, rather, in the public structures and objective conditions that shape those private opinions. One cannot therefore just demand of a public that it change its mind. The public structures mediate what individuals take for granted.<\/span>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: Calibri;color: #000000;\">Option 1: Correct.
