And after a transition, everyone will get richer and smarter and it will all be fine. But you're wrong, because the history of the world suggests that ideological alternatives, and power alternatives, have always arisen to any system, and globalization will be no different.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>This is a legitimate question, so let me try to answer it directly:  I believe that capabilities create intentions. If we create workflow platforms that allow companies to disaggregate any job and source it to the knowledge center anywhere in the world that can perform that task most efficiently at the lowest cost, companies will do that sort of outsourcing. The history of economic development teaches this over and over: If you can do it, you must do it, otherwise your competitors will \u2014 and there is a whole new universe of things that companies, countries, and individuals can and must do to thrive in a flat world. But while I am a technological determinist, I am not a historical determinist. There is absolutely no guarantee that everyone will use these new technologies, or the triple convergence, for the benefit of themselves, their countries, or humanity. Using them does not make you modern, smart, moral, wise, fair, or decent. It just makes you able to communicate, compete, and collaborate farther and faster. But it doesn't have to happen. To put it bluntly, I don't know how the flattening of the world will come out. Indeed, let me go even further and make a deeper confession: I know that the world is not flat. \r<br>\r<br>I am certain, though, that the world has been shrinking and flattening for some time now, and that process has quickened dramatically in recent years. Half the world today is directly or indirectly participating in the flattening process or feeling its effects. But I am equally certain that it is not historically inevitable that the rest of the world will become flat or that the already flat parts of the world won't get unflattened by war, economic disruption, or politics. There are hundreds of millions of people on this planet who have been left behind by the flattening process or feel overwhelmed by it, and some of them have enough access to the flattening tools to use them against the system, not on its behalf.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\"><b>The last paragraph states: \u201c<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\">There are hundreds of millions of people on this planet who have been left behind by the flattening process or feel overwhelmed by it, and some of them have enough access to the flattening tools to use them against the system, not on its behalf.\u201d&nbsp;<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Option 1:<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ;\"> Incorrect.

They also receive feedback from the muscles, tendons, skin and joints \u2013 such as if we\u2019re walking down a slope \u2013 so we can adjust the manner of movement. This may explain why an unconscious person can wander about, in the phenomenon of sleepwalking.<br><br>This ability to move around without thinking about it \u2013 whether fleeing dangerous environments, finding food sources, pursuing prey or outrunning predators \u2013 ensured our survival. The first organisms to leave the sea and colonize the land led to all air-breathing life on earth; they wouldn\u2019t have done so if they\u2019d stayed put.<br><br>But here\u2019s the question: if moving is integral to our well-being and survival, and we\u2019ve evolved sophisticated biological systems to ensure it happens as easily as possible, why does it sometimes make us throw up? This is known as motion sickness. It\u2019s the brain that\u2019s responsible for this, not the stomach. What possible reason could there be for our brains to conclude, in defiance of aeons of evolution, that going from A to B is a legitimate cause for vomiting? Actually, the brain isn\u2019t defying our evolved tendencies. It\u2019s the numerous systems and mechanisms we have to facilitate motion that are responsible. Motion sickness occurs only when you\u2019re travelling by a vehicle. Here\u2019s why. Humans have  a  sophisticated  array  of  senses  and  neurological mechanisms that give rise to proprioception, the ability to sense how our body is currently arranged, and which parts are going where. Put your hand behind your back and you can still sense the hand, know where it is and what rude  gesture  it\u2019s  making,  without  actually  seeing  it.  That\u2019s proprioception. <b> <\/b>","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">The last paragraph asks the question why, if moving is integral to our well-being, why do we get motion sickness.

Work by the cognitive scientist Stephan Lewandowsky, as well as research led by the psychologist Sydney Scott, observed no relation between political ideology and attitudes toward genetic modification. Lewandowsky also found no clear relation between political conservatism and vaccine skepticism.<br><br>So, there is more that underlies science skepticism than just political conservatism. But what? It is important to systematically map which factors do and do not contribute to science skepticism and science (dis)trust in order to provide more precise explanations for why a growing number of individuals reject the notion of anthropogenic climate change, or fear that eating genetically modified products is dangerous, or believe that vaccines cause autism.<br><br>People can be skeptical or distrusting of science for different reasons, whether it is about one specific finding from one discipline (for example, \u2018The climate is not warming, but I believe in evolution\u2019), or about science in general (\u2018Science is just one of many opinions\u2019). In our recently concluded research, we identified four major predictors of science acceptance and science skepticism: political ideology; religiosity; morality; and knowledge about science. These variables tend to intercorrelate \u2013 in some cases quite strongly \u2013 which means that they are potentially confounded. To illustrate, an observed relation between political conservatism and trust in science might in reality be caused by another variable, for example religiosity. When not measuring all constructs simultaneously, it is hard to properly assess what the predictive value of each of these is.<br><br>So, we investigated the heterogeneity of science skepticism among samples of North American participants. We provided participants with statements about climate change, genetic modification and vaccination. Participants could indicate to what extent they agreed or disagreed with these statements. We also measured participants\u2019 general faith in science, and included a task in which they could indicate how much federal money should be spent on science, compared with various other domains. We assessed the impact of political ideology, religiosity, moral concerns and science knowledge (measured with a science literacy test) on participants\u2019 responses.<br><br>The only form of science skepticism that was consistently more pronounced among the politically conservative respondents in our studies was, not surprisingly, climate-change skepticism.  Skepticism about genetic modification correlated strongly with science knowledge: the worse people did on the scientific literacy test, the more skeptical they were about the safety of genetically modified food. Vaccine skepticism had no relation to political ideology, but was strongest among religious participants, with a particular relation to moral concerns about the naturalness of vaccination. A generic trust in science was by far the lowest among the religious. The really orthodox participants were also the least positive about investing federal money in science.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>Option 1: Incorrect. &ldquo;The sociologist Gordon Gauchat has shown that political conservatives in the United States have become more distrusting of science, a trend that started in the 1970s.&rdquo; Option 1 cannot be inferred. <br \/>Option 2: incorrect. &ldquo;Lewandowsky also found no clear relation between political conservatism and vaccine skepticism.&rdquo; Option 2 cannot be inferred.&nbsp; <br \/>Option 3: Incorrect.

They know they will be facing higher taxes, bigger personal debts, and on top of the Covid-19 aftermath, an inevitable and grim climate emergency for the foreseeable future.
