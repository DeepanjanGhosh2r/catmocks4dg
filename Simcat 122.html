Our attention, when we fail to put it to use for our own objectives, becomes a tool to be used and exploited by others.<br \/><br \/>However, conceiving of attention as a resource misses the fact that attention is not&nbsp;just&nbsp;useful. It&rsquo;s more fundamental than that: attention is what joins us with the outside world. &lsquo;Instrumentally&rsquo; attending is important, sure. But we also have the capacity to attend in a more &lsquo;exploratory&rsquo; way: to be truly open to whatever we find before us, without any particular agenda.<br \/><br \/>Treating attention as a resource, as implied by the attention-economy narrative, tells us only half of the overall story. An instrumental mode of attention tends to divide up whatever it&rsquo;s presented with into component parts: to analyse and categorise things so that it can utilise them towards some ends.<br \/><br \/>By contrast, an exploratory mode of attending adopts a more embodied awareness, one that is open to whatever makes itself present before us, in all its fullness. This mode of attending comes into playwhen we pay attention to other people, to the natural world and to works of art. None of those fare too well if we attend to them as a means to an end. <br \/><br \/>It is also the exploratory mode of attention that can connect us to our deepest sense of purpose. Just note how many non-instrumental forms of attention practice lie at the heart of many spiritual traditions. The American Zen teacher David Loy characterises an unenlightened existence (samsara) as simply the state in which one&rsquo;s attention becomes &lsquo;trapped&rsquo; as it grasps from one thing to another, always looking for the next thing to latch on to. Meanwhile,&nbsp;Simone Weil,&nbsp;the French Christian mystic, saw prayer as attention &lsquo;in its pure form&rsquo;; and this, according to her, leads us to &lsquo;the gateway to eternity&hellip;the infinite, in an instant.&rsquo;<\/p>","PassageTitle":"1","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p><span>The fourth paragraph states that, \u201c\u2026conceiving of attention as a resource misses the fact that attention is not\u00a0just\u00a0useful.

Arguments like these provide a convenient primordial imprimatur for all manner of abuses, from the suppression of civil liberties to the rejection of any external criticism.<br \/><br \/>But history is messy. Those trying to maintain a civilizational mindset must willfully debase big portions of it. In India, it is not just colonialism that has distorted the true culture in the eyes of Hindu nationalists. They also resent earlier waves of Muslim conquest and seek to expunge their legacy. Though undoing 800-odd years of Islamic influence is impossible, the Right has used the idea as a successful organizing principle. The Chinese government, too, often chooses to disregard inconvenient episodes. The violent upheaval of the Cultural Revolution sits awkwardly with the claim that the Communist Party is upholding China&rsquo;s time-honoured preference for stability. The reformist movement of 1919, which gave birth to the Communist Party itself, was profoundly critical of Confucianism and other conservative aspects of Chinese culture<span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">.<\/span><\/p>","PassageTitle":"...","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<p>In the last paragraph, the writer states: \u201cThe Chinese government, too, often chooses to disregard inconvenient episodes.

Choose the best answer for each question.<\/strong><br \/><br \/>One of the founding axioms of linguistic theory, articulated by Ferdinand de Saussure in the early 19<sup>th<\/sup>century, is that any particular linguistic sign &ndash; a sound, a mark on the page, a gesture &ndash; is arbitrary, and dictated solely by social convention. Save those rare exceptions such as onomatopoeias, where a word mimics a noise &ndash; e.g., &lsquo;cuckoo&rsquo;, &lsquo;achoo&rsquo; or &lsquo;cock-a-doodle-doo&rsquo; &ndash; there should be&nbsp;no inherent link&nbsp;between the way a word sounds and the concept it represents; unless we have been socialised to think so,&nbsp;nurunuru&nbsp;shouldn&rsquo;t feel more &lsquo;slimy&rsquo; any more than it feels &lsquo;dry&rsquo;.<br \/><br \/>Yet many world languages contain a separate set of words that defies this principle. Known as&nbsp;ideophones, they are considered to be especially vivid and evocative of sensual experiences. Crucially, you do not need to know the language to grasp a hint of their meaning. Studies&nbsp;show&nbsp;that participants lacking any prior knowledge of Japanese, for example, often guess the meanings of ideophones better than chance alone would allow. For many people,&nbsp;nurunuru&nbsp;really does feel &lsquo;slimy&rsquo;;&nbsp;wakuwaku&nbsp;evokes excitement, and&nbsp;kurukuru&nbsp;conjures visions of circular rather than vertical motion. That should simply not be possible, if the sound-meaning relationship was indeed arbitrary. <br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">How and why do ideophones do this? Despite their prevalence in many languages, ideophones were once considered linguistic oddities of marginal interest. As a consequence, linguists, psychologists and neuroscientists have only recently started to unlock their secrets.&nbsp;Their results pose a profound challenge to the foundations of Saussurean linguistics. According to this research, language is<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">embodied<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">: a process that involves subtle feedback, for both listener and speaker, between the sound of a word, the vocal apparatus and our own experience of human physicality. Taken together, this dynamic helps to create a connection between certain sounds and their attendant meanings. These associations appear to be universal across all human societies.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">This understanding of language as an embodied process can illuminate the marvel of language acquisition during infancy. It might even cast light on the evolutionary origins of language itself &ndash; potentially representing a kind of &lsquo;proto-world&rsquo;, a vestige of our ancestors&rsquo; first utterances.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">How should we define an ideophone? All languages contain powerfully emotive or sensual words, after all. But ideophones share a couple of characteristics that make them unique. For one, they constitute their own unique class, marked with their own linguistic rules &ndash; in the same way that, say, nouns or verbs also follow their own rules in how they are formed and used. In Japanese, for instance, ideophones are easy to recognise because they most often take the form of a two-syllable root that is then repeated &ndash; such as<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">gochagocha<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">&nbsp;(messy),<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">nurunuru<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">&nbsp;(slimy) or<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">tsurutsuru<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">&nbsp;(smooth)<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">.<\/span><\/p>","PassageTitle":"........","IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;\">The word is mentioned in paragraph 1, sentence 2, as an example of an onomatopoeic sound, which mimics noise.

Hence O, B and L had odd final score.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0B and L had the same final score, thus the final score of O, B and L must be 5, 7, 7 in the given order.<\/p>\n<p>The results of 4 matches of T is known, and the score of these 4 matches = 3. Since T\u2019s final score must be even, the 5<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0match of T (against B) must have been resulted in a draw. It can be concluded that T = 4.<\/p>\n<p>Out of total 11 points of T + A + Y = 11; two points need to be accounted for the match between A and Y. If A won this match then the total score of Y must be 4; it violates the condition that exactly two teams had same score. Thus, Y won the match against A. Therefore, The following table shows the total points of each team.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/imsclick2cert.blob.core.windows.net\/imsitemimages\/637037145521047389_5279054.GIF\" alt=\"\" width=\"317\" height=\"73\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Since each team lost at least one match,\u00a0Buccaneers must have lost against L or O. If they lost against O, the final score of O would be more than 5 which is not possible. So, B lost against L and won against O. Therefore, the match between O and L must have been resulted in a tie.<\/p>\n<p>The other values in the table can be filled accordingly.
