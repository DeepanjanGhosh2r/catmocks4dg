Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">At the dawn of representative democracy in Europe, two significant voices were raised that questioned its meaning and value at the root. The first \u2013 well known, and tainted by all manner of accusations, from naivety to historical disinformation, an innate tendency towards \u2018\u2018totalitarianism,\u2019\u2019 and so forth \u2013 was that of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. His premise, is that \u2018\u2018sovereignty cannot be represented for the same reason that it cannot be transferred.\u2019\u2019<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Sovereignty consists of \u2018\u2018the general will, and the general will cannot be represented.\u201d From this comes Rousseau\u2019s famous devaluing of the representative system, which by then had been in place in England for many decades: \u2018\u2018The English people believe they are free, but they are grossly mistaken. They are only so during the elections of members of parliament. As soon as these have been elected, the people are immediately consigned to slavery; they are nothing. The way they use their freedom during the brief moments when they possess it means that they thoroughly deserve to lose it.\u2019\u2019<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The acid test, so to speak, for Rousseau lies in the historical precedent of antiquity: \u2018\u2018In the ancient republics, and also in monarchies, the people never had representatives.\u201d It is striking that he is not especially concerned with highlighting the severe limits that the \u2018\u2018free\" English system placed on representation, that is, the system by which members were elected to the House of Commons; it is the existence of representation in itself that is called into question.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">This may seem an extreme paradox but, in a far-seeing way, he emphasizes a disastrous effect of the representative system: the transformation of elected representatives into what we now call a \u2018\u2018political class\u2019\u2019 (whatever their political affiliations), their essential separateness from the specific interests of those who have designated them their representatives, and the way in which they function, at decisive moments, as a separate, self-referential body. Rousseau condemned this vice at the outset from a logical and philosophical standpoint but also from a legal one. This is therefore both an admonition and a premonition.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The other \u2018\u2018preventive admonition\u2019\u2019 is that formulated by Condorcet in 1785\u2026 He argues that confusion must result from any electoral procedure in which voters are presented with more than two choices.

Over the course of the 19th century,\u00a0the particularities of imperial rule in the Baltic, the \u2018Baltic Question\u2019, sparked debates among intellectuals about how to justify Russian imperial rule over non-Russian populations and the relationship between the empire and emerging ideas around a distinctive Russian national culture. One view held that the Baltic provinces were perceived by some as culturally part of \u2018the West\u2019 and used to present Russia as a truly European empire. Conversely, the ethnolinguistic and religious diversity of the borderlands was perceived\u00a0by others as an extension of\u00a0\u2018the West\u2019 into Russia\u2019s borders and a potential threat to the development of Russia\u2019s unique national culture.<br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Rittikh\u2019s peers in the Geographical Society held his maps in high esteem.

One such mapmaker was Mat\u012bss Sili\u0146\u0161, a schoolteacher and publisher of popular calendars, who began regularly creating Latvian-language maps in Riga in the 1890s for mass audiences. While Mat\u012bss did not go so far as to advocate Latvian independence, his maps consolidated the idea of\u00a0a distinctive and vibrant Latvian territory within the Russian Empire. They signified a radical departure from seeing the Baltics only through the lens of Russian or German possessions or sphere of influence.

[\u2026] We can easily push this question back one step. As of AD 1500, when Europe\u2019s worldwide colonial expansion was just beginning, peoples on different continents already differed greatly in technology and political organization. Much of Europe, Asia, and North Africa was the site of metal-equipped states or empires, some of them on the threshold of industrialization. Two Native American peoples, the Aztecs and the Incas, ruled over empires with stone tools. Parts of sub-Saharan Africa were divided among small states or chiefdoms with iron tools. Most other peoples [\u2026] lived as farming tribes or even still as hunter-gatherer bands using stone tools.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">\u2026Empires with steel weapons were able to conquer or exterminate tribes with weapons of stone and wood\u2026Once again, we can easily push this question back one step further, by drawing on written histories and archaeological discoveries. Until the end of the last Ice Age, around 11,000 BC, all peoples on all continents were still hunter-gatherers. Different rates of development on different continents, from 11,000 BC to AD 1500, were what led to the technological and political inequalities of AD 1500. While Aboriginal Australians and many Native Americans remained hunter-gatherers, most of Eurasia and much of the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa gradually developed agriculture, herding, metallurgy, and complex political organization\u2026<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">[So] why did human development proceed at such different rates on different continents? Probably the commonest explanation involves implicitly or explicitly assuming biological differences among peoples\u2026 The displacement of [technologically primitive peoples] by colonists from industrialized <\/span>societies exemplified the survival of the fittest\u2026 Europeans became considered genetically more intelligent than Africans and Aboriginal Australians.<br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Today, segments of Western society publicly repudiate racism. Yet many Westerners continue to accept racist explanations privately or sub-consciously\u2026 The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong\u2026 An enormous effort by cognitive psychologists has gone into the search for differences in IQ between peoples of different geographic origins now living in the same country\u2026 However, the peoples compared differ greatly in their social environment and educational opportunities. First, even our cognitive abilities as adults are heavily influenced by the social environment that we experienced during childhood, making it hard to discern any influence of preexisting genetic differences. Second, tests of cognitive ability (like IQ test) tend to measure cultural learning and not pure innate intelligence, whatever that is\u2026<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">[So], there is no generally accepted answer to the [original] question.

Option 3 suggests that the conquered peoples continue to be underclass even after technological advancement, which would call into question the idea that social and environmental factors are primarily responsible for differences in wealth and power distribution.<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Hence, [4].<\/span>","ItemBankID":0,"Difficulty":"Easy","DifficultyLevel":"1669640319437","ItemBank":0,"QuestionPaper":0,"IsProofRead":null,"CorrectIndex":0,"QuestionPaperSectionID":1685085696124,"IsRequiredQuestion":null,"TestID":0,"IsQuestionPackTimer":null,"ItemOptionResponse":[{"ItemOptionID":"1685443248279110","ItemID":168544324827911,"Options":"<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The existence of human differences in intelligence parallels human differences in technology.<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"1685443248279111","ItemID":168544324827911,"Options":"<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">History's pattern reflects innate differences among people themselves in different continents.<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"1685443248279112","ItemID":168544324827911,"Options":"<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The conquered peoples continue to be underclass even after technological advancement.<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":false,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0},{"ItemOptionID":"1685443248279113","ItemID":168544324827911,"Options":"<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Class differences can be attributed to social disadvantages and limited opportunities.<\/span>","RHSOption":null,"MarkedIndex":null,"OrderNumber":null,"OptionIndex":null,"IsCorrect":true,"IsHTML":false,"RHSIsHTML":false,"ColumnID":0,"DrpIdentifier":null,"ItemReferenceID":0}],"ItemMatrixSelectedColumns":[],"ItemMatrixResponse":[],"IsPassageQuestionSplit":true,"VideoExplanation":null,"PlayerMode":"S3","VimeoLink":null,"VimeoURI":null,"BookReference":null,"qindex":11,"qsectionindex":0,"qindexbysection":11},{"MaxWords":0,"ItemID":168544324827912,"ItemType":"mcq","SubjectName":"Verbal Ability","SubjectID":1589191865762,"AreaName":"Reading Comprehension","AreaID":1589191865815,"TopicName":"Central Idea","TopicID":1589191866680,"SubTopicName":"Central Idea","SubTopicID":1589191866728,"ItemOptions":null,"StarRating":null,"ItemBankName":null,"Direction":null,"IsApproved":null,"Items":"<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"><\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Which of the following best expresses the main argument of the passage?<\/span>","ItemPassageID":16854432482734,"PassageItemIndex":0,"Passage":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"><b>The passage below is accompanied by a set of questions.

The complexity\u2014and the information\u2014in DNA come from the linear arrangement of these nucleotides along the molecule. Like the amino acids in proteins, nucleotides in DNA form the alphabet in which DNA\u2019s information is encoded. Nucleotides, in turn, can be broken down into even simpler components: a sugar, a phosphate ion, and a simple organic molecule called a base. The bases can be synthesized from simple compounds likely to have been present when the Earth was young. Moreover, sugars can be generated from simple precursors like formaldehyde, also thought to have been present on the ancient Earth. And phosphate ions would have been supplied by the chemical weathering of volcanic rocks. Combining these components to form nucleotides challenged scientists for decades, but in 2009, British chemist John Sutherland and his colleagues generated two types of nucleotides under plausible early Earth conditions.<\/span><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Finally, there are lipids, molecular constituents of the membranes that bound all cells. Like proteins and DNA, lipids are made of simpler units, in this case long, chain-like molecules called fatty acids, again likely generated chemically on the early Earth.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">DNA, the cell\u2019s instruction manual and evolutionary memory, is fiendishly complex, but it has only four distinct components, called nucleotides. The complexity\u2014and the information\u2014in DNA come from the linear arrangement of these nucleotides along the molecule. Like the amino acids in proteins, nucleotides in DNA form the alphabet in which DNA\u2019s information is encoded. Nucleotides, in turn, can be broken down into even simpler components: a sugar, a phosphate ion, and a simple organic molecule called a base. The bases can be synthesized from simple compounds likely to have been present when the Earth was young. Moreover, sugars can be generated from simple precursors like formaldehyde, also thought to have been present on the ancient Earth. And phosphate ions would have been supplied by the chemical weathering of volcanic rocks. Combining these components to form nucleotides challenged scientists for decades, but in 2009, British chemist John Sutherland and his colleagues generated two types of nucleotides under plausible early Earth conditions.<\/span><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Finally, there are lipids, molecular constituents of the membranes that bound all cells. Like proteins and DNA, lipids are made of simpler units, in this case long, chain-like molecules called fatty acids, again likely generated chemically on the early Earth. Remarkably, if you splash or evaporate water that contains dispersed fatty acids, they spontaneously come together to form spheroidal microstructures that have a lot in common with the membranes that bound bacteria.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">So, the principal building blocks of life, the molecules from which our cells are built, can form from natural processes under conditions plausibly found locally if not ubiquitously in our planet\u2019s infancy. It is important to underscore that this conclusion is not merely theoretical, or, for that matter, experimental. We know that reactions of the type just outlined did occur billions of years ago; their record is preserved in meteorites, those remarkable relics of our solar system in statu nascendi\u2026 The chemistry from which life emerged may be widespread in the universe.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">So far, so good, but from here things get trickier. We know that amino acids can combine to form short linear molecules called peptides. And nucleotides can do much the same. Function and memory seem to be imminent in such molecules, but in living organisms, DNA provides the molecular instructions for protein synthesis, and proteins are needed to replicate DNA. How do we escape the chicken-and-egg dilemma of which came first?<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The answer may be that neither DNA nor proteins were present in the first evolving protoorganisms. Since 1970, the known diversity of RNA molecules has expanded amazingly, as has their documented range of function. RNA stores information, like its cousin DNA, but some RNAs act like enzymes, doing the cell\u2019s molecular work in a way once thought to be the exclusive domain of proteins. Also, small <\/span>RNA molecules are now known to play a role in regulating gene expression within cells\u2026 Finally, recent experiments have shown that RNA molecules synthesized in the laboratory can evolve, shaped by selection to perform specific tasks. The discovery that RNA molecules can store information, function as enzymes, and evolve leads to a big thought: perhaps the earliest entities that reproduced and evolved were made of RNA, not DNA and proteins.","PassageTitle":null,"IsLinkedQuestion":null,"Points":3,"NegativePoints":1,"SkippedPoints":0,"Explanation":"<\/span>\t<span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Enzyme activity was \u201conce thought to be the exclusive domain of proteins.\u201d \u2013 that means nothing else, including DNA, does enzyme activity.
